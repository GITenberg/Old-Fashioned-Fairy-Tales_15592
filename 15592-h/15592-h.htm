    <h2><a name="PREFACE"
       id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

    <p>As the title of this story-book may possibly suggest that
    the tales are old fairy tales told afresh, it seems well to
    explain that this is not so.</p>

    <p>Except for the use of common "properties" of Fairy Drama,
    and a scrupulous endeavour to conform to tradition in local
    colour and detail, the stories are all new.</p>

    <p>They have appeared at intervals during some years past in
    "<span class="smcap">Aunt Judy's Magazine for Young
    People</span>," and were written in conformity to certain
    theories respecting stories of this kind, with only two of
    which shall the kindly reader of prefaces be troubled.</p>

    <p>First, that there are ideas and types, occurring in the
    myths of all countries, which are common properties, to use
    which does not lay the teller of fairy tales open to the charge
    of plagiarism. Such as the idea of the weak outwitting the
    strong; the failure of man to choose wisely when he may have
    his wish; or the desire of sprites to exchange their careless
    and unfettered existence for the pains and penalties of
    humanity, if they may thereby share in the hopes of the human
    soul.</p>

    <p>Secondly, that in these household stories (the models for
    which were originally oral tradition) the thing most to be
    avoided is a discursive or descriptive style of writing.
    Brevity and epigram must ever be soul of their wit, and they
    should be written as tales that are told.</p>

    <p>The degree in which, if at all, the following tales fulfil
    these conditions, nursery critics must decide.</p>

    <p>There are older critics before whom fairy tales, as such,
    need excuse, even if they do not meet with positive
    disapprobation.</p>

    <p>On this score I can only say that, for myself, I believe
    them to be&mdash;beyond all need of defence&mdash;most valuable
    literature for the young. I do not believe that wonder-tales
    confuse children's ideas of truth. If there are young
    intellects so imperfect as to be incapable of distinguishing
    between fancy and falsehood, it is surely most desirable to
    develop in them the power to do so; but, as a rule, in
    childhood we appreciate the distinction with a vivacity which,
    as elders, our care-clogged memories fail to recall.</p>

    <p>Moreover fairy tales have positive uses in education, which
    no cramming of facts, and no merely domestic fiction can
    serve.</p>

    <p>Like Proverbs and Parables, they deal with first principles
    under the simplest forms. They convey knowledge of the world,
    shrewd lessons of virtue and vice, of common sense and sense of
    humour, of the seemly and the absurd, of pleasure and pain,
    success and failure, in narratives where the plot moves briskly
    and dramatically from a beginning to an end. They treat, not of
    the corner of a nursery or a playground, but of the world at
    large, and life in perspective; of forces visible and
    invisible; of Life, Death, and Immortality.</p>

    <p>For causes obvious to the student of early myths, they
    foster sympathy with nature, and no class of child-literature
    has done so much to inculcate the love of animals.</p>

    <p>They cultivate the Imagination, that great gift which time
    and experience lead one more and more to value&mdash;handmaid
    of Faith, of Hope, and, perhaps most of all, of Charity!</p>

    <p>It is true that some of the old fairy tales do not teach the
    high and useful lessons that most of them do; and that they
    unquestionably deal now and again with phases of grown-up life,
    and with crimes and catastrophes, that seem unsuitable for
    nursery entertainment.</p>

    <p>As to the latter question, it must be remembered that the
    brevity of the narrative&mdash;whether it be a love story or a
    robber story&mdash;deprives it of all harm; a point which
    writers of modern fairy tales do not always realize for their
    guidance.</p>

    <p>The writer of the following tales has endeavoured to bear
    this principle in mind, and it is hoped that the
    morals&mdash;and it is of the essence of fairy tales to have a
    moral&mdash;of all of them are beyond reproach.</p>

    <p>For the rest they are committed to the indulgence of the
    gentle reader.</p>

    <p>Hans Anderssen, perhaps the greatest writer of modern fairy
    tales, was content to say:</p>

    <h2><a name="GOOD_LUCK_IS_BETTER_THAN_GOLD"
       id="GOOD_LUCK_IS_BETTER_THAN_GOLD"></a>GOOD LUCK IS BETTER
       THAN GOLD.</h2>

    <p>There was once upon a time a child who had Good Luck for his
    godfather.</p>

    <p>"I am not Fortune," said Good Luck to the parents; "I have
    no gifts to bestow, but whenever he needs help I will be at
    hand."</p>

    <p>"Nothing could be better," said the old couple. They were
    delighted. But what pleases the father often fails to satisfy
    the son: moreover, every man thinks that he deserves just a
    little more than he has got, and does not reckon it to the
    purpose if his father had less.</p>

    <p>Many a one would be thankful to have as good reasons for
    contentment as he who had Good Luck for his godfather.</p>

    <p>If he fell, Good Luck popped something soft in the way to
    break his fall; if he fought, Good Luck directed his blows, or
    tripped up his adversary; if he got into a scrape, Good Luck
    helped him out of it; and if ever Misfortune met him, Good Luck
    contrived to hustle her on the pathway till his godson got
    safely by.</p>

    <p>In games of hazard the godfather played over his shoulder.
    In matters of choice he chose for him. And when the lad began
    to work on his father's farm the farmer began to get rich. For
    no bird or field-mouse touched a seed that his son had sown,
    and every plant he planted throve when Good Luck smiled on
    it.</p>

    <p>The boy was not fond of work, but when he did go into the
    fields, Good Luck followed him.</p>

    <p>"Your christening-day was a blessed day for us all," said
    the old farmer.</p>

    <p>"He has never given me so much as a lucky sixpence,"
    muttered Good Luck's godson.</p>

    <p>"I am not Fortune&mdash;I make no presents," said the
    godfather.</p>

    <p>When we are discontented it is oftener to please our
    neighbours than ourselves. It was because the other boys had
    said&mdash;"Simon, the shoemaker's son, has an alderman for his
    godfather. He gave him a silver spoon with the Apostle Peter
    for the handle; but thy godfather is more powerful than any
    alderman"&mdash;that Good Luck's godson complained, "He has
    never given me so much as a bent sixpence."</p>

    <p>By and by the old farmer died, and his son grew up, and had
    the largest farm in the country. The other boys grew up also,
    and as they looked over the farmer's boundary-wall, they would
    say:</p>

    <p>"Good-morning, Neighbour. That is certainly a fine farm of
    yours. Your cattle thrive without loss. Your crops grow in the
    rain and are reaped with the sunshine. Mischance never comes
    your road. What you have worked for you enjoy. Such success
    would turn the heads of poor folk like us. At the same time one
    would think a man need hardly work for his living at all who
    has Good Luck for his godfather."</p>

    <p>"That is very true," thought the farmer. "Many a man is
    prosperous, and reaps what he sows, who had no more than the
    clerk and the sexton for gossips at his christening."</p>

    <p>"What is the matter, Godson?" asked Good Luck, who was with
    him in the field.</p>

    <p>"I want to be rich," said the farmer.</p>

    <p>"You will not have to wait long," replied the godfather. "In
    every field you sow, in every flock you rear there is increase
    without abatement. Your wealth is already tenfold greater than
    your father's."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye," replied the farmer. "Good wages for good work.
    But many a young man has gold at his command who need never
    turn a sod, and none of the Good People came to <i>his</i>
    christening. Fortunatus's Purse now, or even a sack or two of
    gold&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Peace!" cried the godfather; "I have said that I give no
    gifts."</p>

    <p>Though he had not Fortunatus's Purse, the farmer had now
    money and to spare, and when the harvest was gathered in, he
    bought a fine suit of clothes, and took his best horse and went
    to the royal city to see the sights.</p>

    <p>The pomp and splendour, the festivities and fine clothes
    dazzled him.</p>

    <p>"This is a gay life which these young courtiers lead," said
    he. "A man has nothing to do but to enjoy himself."</p>

    <p>"If he has plenty of gold in his pocket," said a
    bystander.</p>

    <p>By and by the Princess passed in her carriage. She was the
    King's only daughter. She had hair made of sunshine, and her
    eyes were stars.</p>

    <p>"What an exquisite creature!" cried the farmer. "What would
    not one give to possess her?"</p>

    <p>"She has as many suitors as hairs on her head," replied the
    bystander. "She wants to marry the Prince of Moonshine, but he
    only dresses in silver, and the King thinks he might find a
    richer son-in-law. The Princess will go to the highest
    bidder."</p>

    <p>"And I have Good Luck for my godfather, and am not even at
    court!" cried the farmer; and he put spurs to his horse, and
    rode home.</p>

    <p>Good Luck was taking care of the farm.</p>

    <p>"Listen, Godfather!" cried the young man. "I am in love with
    the King's daughter, and want her to wife."</p>

    <p>"It is not an easy matter," replied Good Luck, "but I will
    do what I can for you. Say that by good luck you saved the
    Princess's life, or perhaps better the King's&mdash;for they
    say he is selfish&mdash;"</p>

    <p>"Tush!" cried the farmer. "The King is covetous, and wants a
    rich son-in-law."</p>

    <p>"A wise man may bring wealth to a kingdom with his head, if
    not with his hands," said Good Luck, "and I can show you a
    district where the earth only wants mining to be flooded with
    wealth. Besides, there are a thousand opportunities that can be
    turned to account and influence. By wits and work, and with
    Good Luck to help him, many a poorer man than you has risen to
    greatness."</p>

    <p>"Wits and work!" cried the indignant godson. "You speak
    well&mdash;truly! A hillman would have made a better godfather.
    Give me as much gold as will fill three meal-bins, and you may
    keep the rest of your help for those who want it."</p>

    <p>Now at this moment by Good Luck stood Dame Fortune. She
    likes handsome young men, and there was some little jealousy
    between her and the godfather so she smiled at the quarrel.</p>

    <p>"You would rather have had me for your gossip?" said
    she.</p>

    <p>"If you would give me three wishes, I would," replied the
    farmer boldly, "and I would trouble you no more."</p>

    <p>"Will you make him over to me?" said Dame Fortune to the
    godfather.</p>

    <p>"If he wishes it," replied Good Luck. "But if he accepts
    your gifts he has no further claim on me."</p>

    <p>"Nor on me either," said the Dame. "Hark ye, young man, you
    mortals are apt to make a hobble of your three wishes, and you
    may end with a sausage at your nose, like your betters."</p>

    <p>"I have thought of it too often," replied the farmer, "and I
    know what I want. For my first wish I desire imperishable
    beauty."</p>

    <p>"It is yours," said Dame Fortune, smiling as she looked at
    him.</p>

    <p>"The face of a prince and the manners of a clown are poor
    partners," said the farmer. "My second wish is for suitable
    learning and courtly manners, which cannot be gained at the
    plough-tail."</p>

    <p>"You have them in perfection," said the Dame, as the young
    man thanked her by a graceful bow.</p>

    <p>"Thirdly," said he, "I demand a store of gold that I can
    never exhaust."</p>

    <p>"I will lead you to it," said Dame Fortune; and the young
    man was so eager to follow her that he did not even look back
    to bid farewell to his godfather.</p>

    <p>He was soon at court. He lived in the utmost pomp. He had a
    suit of armour made for himself out of beaten gold. No metal
    less precious might come near his person, except for the blade
    of his sword. This was obliged to be made of steel, for gold is
    not always strong enough to defend one's life or his honour.
    But the Princess still loved the Prince of Moonshine.</p>

    <p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said the King. "I shall give you to
    the Prince of Gold."</p>

    <p>"I wish I had the good luck to please her," muttered the
    young Prince. But he had not, for all his beauty and his
    wealth. However, she was to marry him, and that was
    something.</p>

    <p>The preparations for the wedding were magnificent.</p>

    <p>"It is a great expense," sighed the King, "but then I get
    the Prince of Gold for a son-in-law."</p>

    <p>The Prince and his bride drove round the city in a triumphal
    procession. Her hair fell over her like sunshine, but the
    starlight of her eyes was cold.</p>

    <p>In the train rode the Prince of Moonshine, dressed in
    silver, and with no colour in his face.</p>

    <p>As the bridal chariot approached one of the city gates, two
    black ravens hovered over it, and then flew away, and settled
    on a tree.</p>

    <p>Good Luck was sitting under the tree to see his godson's
    triumph, and he heard the birds talking above him.</p>

    <p>"Has the Prince of Gold no friend who can tell him that
    there is a loose stone above the archway that is tottering to
    fall?" said they. And Good Luck covered his face with his
    mantle as the Prince drove through.</p>

    <p>Just as they were passing out of the gateway the stone fell
    on to the Prince's head. He wore a casque of pure gold, but his
    neck was broken.</p>
    <br>


    <div class="blockquot">
        <p>"We can't have all this expense for nothing," said the
        King: so he married his daughter to the Prince of
        Moonshine. If one can't get gold one must be content with
        silver.</p>
    </div>
    <br>


    <p>"Will you come to the funeral?" asked Dame Fortune of the
    godfather.</p>

    <p>"Not I," replied Good Luck. "I had no hand in <i>this</i>
    matter."</p>

    <p>The rain came down in torrents. The black feathers on the
    ravens' backs looked as if they had been oiled.</p>

    <p>"Caw! caw!" said they. "It was an unlucky end."</p>

    <p>However, the funeral was a very magnificent one, for there
    was no stint of gold.</p>

       id="THE_HILLMAN_AND_THE_HOUSEWIFE"></a>THE HILLMAN AND THE
       HOUSEWIFE.</h2>

    <p>It is well known that the Good People cannot abide meanness.
    They like to be liberally dealt with when they beg or borrow of
    the human race; and, on the other hand, to those who come to
    them in need, they are invariably generous.</p>

    <p>Now there once lived a certain Housewife who had a sharp eye
    to her own interests in temporal matters, and gave alms of what
    she had no use for, for the good of her soul. One day a Hillman
    knocked at her door.</p>

    <p>"Can you lend us a saucepan, good Mother?" said he. "There's
    a wedding in the hill, and all the pots are in use."</p>

    <p>"Is he to have one?" asked the servant lass who had opened
    the door.</p>

    <p>"Aye, to be sure," answered the Housewife. "One must be
    neighbourly."</p>

    <p>But when the maid was taking a saucepan from the shelf, she
    pinched her arm, and whispered sharply&mdash;"Not that, you
    slut! Get the old one out of the cupboard. It leaks, and the
    Hillmen are so neat, and such nimble workers, that they are
    sure to mend it before they send it home. So one obliges the
    Good People, and saves sixpence in tinkering. But you'll never
    learn to be notable whilst your head is on your shoulders."</p>

    <p>Thus reproached, the maid fetched the saucepan, which had
    been laid by till the tinker's next visit, and gave it to the
    dwarf, who thanked her, and went away.</p>

    <p>In due time the saucepan was returned, and, as the Housewife
    had foreseen, it was neatly mended and ready for use.</p>

    <p>At supper-time the maid filled the pan with milk, and set it
    on the fire for the children's supper. But in a few minutes the
    milk was so burnt and smoked that no one could touch it, and
    even the pigs refused the wash into which it was thrown.</p>

    <p>"Ah, good-for-nothing hussy!" cried the Housewife, as she
    refilled the pan herself, "you would ruin the richest with your
    carelessness. There's a whole quart of good milk wasted at
    once!"</p>

    <p>"<i>And that's twopence</i>," cried a voice which seemed to
    come from the chimney, in a whining tone, like some nattering,
    discontented old body going over her grievances.</p>

    <p>The Housewife had not left the saucepan for two minutes,
    when the milk boiled over, and it was all burnt and smoked as
    before.</p>

    <p>"The pan must be dirty," muttered the good woman, in great
    vexation; "and there are two full quarts of milk as good as
    thrown to the dogs."</p>

    <p>"<i>And that's fourpence</i>," added the voice in the
    chimney.</p>

    <p>After a thorough cleaning, the saucepan was once more filled
    and set on the fire, but with no better success. The milk was
    hopelessly spoilt, and the housewife shed tears of vexation at
    the waste, crying, "Never before did such a thing befall me
    since I kept house! Three quarts of new milk burnt for one
    meal!"</p>

    <p>"<i>And that's sixpence</i>," cried the voice from the
    chimney. "<i>You didn't save the tinkering after all
    Mother!</i>"</p>

    <p>With which the Hillman himself came tumbling down the
    chimney, and went off laughing through the door.</p>

    <p>But thenceforward the saucepan was as good as any other.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_NECK"
       id="THE_NECK"></a>THE NECK.</h2>

    <h3 class="center"><span class="smcap">a legend of a
    lake.</span></h3>

    <p>On a certain lake there once lived a Neck, or Water Sprite,
    who desired, above all things, to obtain a human soul. Now when
    the sun shone this Neck rose up and sat upon the waves and
    played upon his harp. And he played so sweetly that the winds
    stayed to listen to him, and the sun lingered in his setting,
    and the moon rose before her time. And the strain was in praise
    of immortality.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, out of the lake there rose a great rock,
    whereon dwelt an aged hermit, who by reason of his loneliness
    was afflicted with a spirit of melancholy; so that when the fit
    was on him, he was constantly tempted to throw himself into the
    water, for his life was burdensome to him. But one day, when
    this gloomy madness had driven him to the edge of the rock to
    cast himself down, the Neck rose at the same moment, and
    sitting upon a wave, began to play. And the strain was in
    praise of immortality. And the melody went straight to the
    heart of the hermit as a sunbeam goes into a dark cave, and it
    dispelled his gloom, and he thought all to be as well with him
    as before it had seemed ill. And he called to the Neck and
    said, "What is that which thou dost play, my son?"</p>

    <p>And the Neck answered, "It is in praise of immortality."</p>

    <p>Then said the hermit, "I beg that thou wilt play frequently
    beneath this rock; for I am an aged and solitary man, and by
    reason of my loneliness, life becomes a burden to me, and I am
    tempted to throw it away. But by this gracious strain the evil
    has been dispelled. Wherefore I beg thee to come often and to
    play as long as is convenient. And yet I cannot offer thee any
    reward, for I am poor and without possessions."</p>

    <p>Then the Neck replied, "There are treasures below the water
    as above, and I desire no earthly riches. But if thou canst
    tell me how I may gain a human soul, I will play on till thou
    shalt bid me cease."</p>

    <p>And the hermit said, "I must consider the matter. But I will
    return to-morrow at this time and answer thee."</p>

    <p>Then the next day he returned as he had said, and the Neck
    was waiting impatiently on the lake, and he cried, "What news,
    my father?"</p>

    <p>And the hermit said, "If that at any time some human being
    will freely give his life for thee, thou wilt gain a human
    soul. But thou also must die the selfsame day."</p>

    <p>"The short life for the long one!" cried the Neck; and he
    played a melody so full of happiness that the blood danced
    through the hermit's veins as if he were a boy again. But the
    next day when he came as usual the Neck called to him and said,
    "My father, I have been thinking. Thou art aged and feeble, and
    at the most there are but few days of life remaining to thee.
    Moreover, by reason of thy loneliness even these are a burden.
    Surely there is none more fit than thou to be the means of
    procuring me a human soul. Wherefore I beg of thee, let us die
    to-day."</p>

    <p>But the hermit cried out angrily, "Wretch! Is this thy
    gratitude? Wouldst thou murder me?"</p>

    <p>"Nay, old man," replied the Neck, "thou shalt part easily
    with thy little fag-end of life. I can play upon my harp a
    strain of such surpassing sadness that no human heart that
    hears it but must break. And yet the pain of that heartbreak
    shall be such that thou wilt not know it from rapture.
    Moreover, when the sun sets below the water, my spirit also
    will depart without suffering. Wherefore I beg of thee, let us
    die to-day."</p>

    <p>"Truly," said the hermit, "it is because thou art only a
    Neck, and nothing better, that thou dost not know the value of
    human life."</p>

    <p>"And art thou a man, possessed already of a soul, and
    destined for immortality," cried the Neck, "and dost haggle and
    grudge to benefit me by the sacrifice of a few uncertain days,
    when it is but to exchange them for the life that knows no
    end?"</p>

    <p>"Our days are always uncertain," replied the hermit; "but
    existence is very sweet, even to the most wretched. Moreover, I
    see not that thou hast any claim upon mine." Saying which he
    returned to his cell, but the Neck, flinging aside his harp,
    sat upon the water, and wept bitterly.</p>

    <p>Days passed, and the hermit did not show himself, and at
    last the Neck resolved to go and visit him. So he took his
    harp, and taking also the form of a boy with long fair hair and
    a crimson cap, he appeared in the hermit's cell. There he found
    the old man stretched upon his pallet, for lie was dying. When
    he saw the Neck he was glad, and said, "I have desired to see
    thee, for I repent myself that I did not according to thy
    wishes. Yet is the desire of life stronger in the human breast
    than thou canst understand. Nevertheless I am sorry, and I am
    sorry also that, as I am sick unto death, my life will no
    longer avail thee. But when I am dead, do thou take all that
    belongs to me, and dress thyself in my robe, and go out into
    the world, and do works of mercy, and perchance some one whom
    thou hast benefited will be found willing to die with thee,
    that thou mayst obtain a soul."</p>

    <p>"Now indeed I thank thee!" cried the Neck. "But yet one word
    more&mdash;what are these works of which thou speakest?"</p>

    <p>"The corporal works of mercy are seven," gasped the hermit,
    raising himself on his arm. "To feed the hungry and give the
    thirsty drink, to visit the sick, to redeem captives, to clothe
    the naked, to shelter the stranger and the houseless, to visit
    the widow and fatherless, and to bury the dead." Then even as
    he spoke the last words the hermit died. And the Neck clothed
    himself in his robe, and, not to delay in following the
    directions given to him, he buried the hermit with pious care,
    and planted flowers upon his grave. After which he went forth
    into the world.</p>

    <p>Now for three hundred years did the Neck go about doing acts
    of mercy and charity towards men. And amongst the hungry, and
    the naked, and the sick, and the poor, and the captives, there
    were not a few who seemed to be weary of this life of many
    sorrows. But when he had fed the hungry, and clothed the naked,
    and relieved the sick, and made the poor rich, and set the
    captive free, life was too dear to all of them to be given up.
    Therefore he betook himself to the most miserable amongst men,
    and offering nothing but an easy death in a good cause, he
    hoped to find some aged and want-worn creature who would do him
    the kindness he desired. But of those who must look forward to
    the fewest days and to the most misery there was not one but,
    like the fabled woodcutter, chose to trudge out to the end his
    miserable span.</p>

    <p>So when three hundred years were past, the Neck's heart
    failed him, and he said, "All this avails nothing. Wherefore I
    will return to the lake, and there abide what shall befall."
    And this he accordingly did.</p>

    <p>Now one evening there came a tempest down from the hills,
    and there was a sudden squall on the lake. And a certain young
    man in a boat upon the lake was overtaken by the storm. And as
    he struggled hard, and it seemed as if every moment must be his
    last, a young maid who was his sweetheart came down to the
    shore, and cried aloud in her agony, "Alas, that his young life
    should be cut short thus!"</p>

    <p>"Trouble not thyself," said the Neck; "this life is so short
    and so uncertain, that if he were rescued to-day he might be
    taken from thee to-morrow. Only in eternity is love secure.
    Wherefore be patient, and thou shalt soon follow him."</p>

    <p>"And who art thou that mockest my sorrow?" cried the
    maiden.</p>

    <p>"One who has watched the passing misfortunes of many
    generations before thine," replied the Neck.</p>

    <p>And when the maiden looked, and saw one like a little old
    man wringing out his beard into the lake, she knew it was a
    Neck, and cried, "Now surely thou art a Neck, and they say,
    'When Necks play, the winds wisht;' wherefore I beg of thee to
    play upon thy harp, and it may be that the storm will lull, and
    my beloved will be saved."</p>

    <p>But the Neck answered, "It is not worth while."</p>

    <p>And when the maiden could not persuade him, she fell upon
    her face in bitter grief, and cried, "Oh, my Beloved! Would GOD
    I could die for thee!"</p>

    <p>"And yet thou wouldst not if thou couldst," said the
    Neck.</p>

    <p>"If it be in thy power to prove me&mdash;prove me!" cried
    the maiden; "for indeed he is the only stay of aged parents,
    and he is young and unprepared for death. Moreover his life is
    dearer to me than my own."</p>

    <p>Then the Neck related his own story, and said, "If thou wilt
    do this for me, which none yet has done whom I have benefited,
    I will play upon my harp, and if the winds wisht, thou must die
    this easy death; but if I fail in my part, I shall not expect
    thine to be fulfilled. And we must both abide what shall
    befall, even as others." And to this the maiden consented most
    willingly. Only she said, "Do this for me, I beg of thee. Let
    him come so near that I may just see his face before I die."
    And it was so agreed.</p>

    <p>Then the aged Neck drew forth his harp and began to play.
    And as he played the wind stayed, as one who pauses to hearken
    with cleft lips, and the lake rose and fell gently, like the
    bosom of a girl moved by some plaintive song, and the sun burst
    forth as if to see who made such sweet music. And so through
    this happy change the young man got safe to land. Then the Neck
    turned to the maiden and said, "Dost thou hold to thy promise?"
    And she bowed her head.</p>

    <p>"In the long life be thy recompense!" cried the Neck,
    fervently, and taking his harp again, he poured his whole
    spirit into the strain. And as he played, it seemed as if the
    night wind moaned among pine-trees, but it was more mournful.
    And it was as the wail of a mother for her only son, and yet
    fuller of grief. Or like a Dead March wrung from the heart of a
    great musician&mdash;loading the air with sorrow&mdash;and yet
    all these were as nothing to it for sadness. And when the
    maiden heard it, it was more than she could bear, and her heart
    broke, as the Neck had said. Then the young man sprang to
    shore, and when she could see his face clearly, her soul
    passed, and her body fell like a snapped flower to the
    earth.</p>

    <p>Now when the young man knew what was befallen, he fell upon
    the Neck to kill him, who said, "Thou mayest spare thyself this
    trouble, for in a few moments I shall be dead. But do thou take
    my robe and my harp, and thou shalt be a famous musician."</p>

    <p>Now even as the Neck spoke the sun sank, and he fell upon
    his face. And when the young man lifted the robe, behold there
    was nothing under it but the harp, across which there swept
    such a wild and piteous chord that all the strings burst as if
    with unutterable grief.</p>

    <p>Then the young man lifted the body of his sweetheart in his
    arms, and carried her home, and she was buried with many
    tears.</p>

    <p>And in due time he put fresh strings to the harp, which,
    though it was not as when it was in the hands of the Neck, yet
    it made most exquisite music. And the young man became a famous
    musician. For out of suffering comes song.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, he occupied himself in good works until that
    his time also came.</p>
    <hr style='width: 45%;'>

    <p>And in Eternity Love was made secure.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_NIX_IN_MISCHIEF"
       id="THE_NIX_IN_MISCHIEF"></a>THE NIX IN MISCHIEF.</h2>

    <p>A certain lake in Germany was once the home of a Nix, who
    became tired of the monotony of life under water, and wished to
    go into the upper world and amuse himself.</p>

    <p>His friends and relations all tried to dissuade him. "Be
    wise," said they, "and remain where you are safe, seeing that
    no business summons you from the lake. Few of our kindred have
    had dealings with the human race without suffering from their
    curiosity or clumsiness; and, do them what good you may, in the
    long run you will reap nothing but ingratitude. From how many
    waters have they not already banished us? Wherefore let well
    alone, and stay where you are."</p>

    <p>But this counsel did not please the Nix&mdash;(as, indeed,
    there is no reason to suppose that advice is more palatable
    under water than on dry land)&mdash;and he only said, "I shall
    not expect gratitude, for I have no intention of conferring
    benefits; but I wish to amuse myself. The Dwarfs and Kobolds
    play what pranks they please on men and women, and they do not
    always have the worst of it. When I hear of their adventures,
    the soles of my feet tingle. This is a sign of travelling, and
    am I to be debarred from fun because I live in a lake instead
    of a hill?"</p>

    <p>His friends repeated their warnings, but to no purpose. The
    Nix remained unconvinced, and spent his time in dreaming of the
    clever tricks by which he should outwit the human race, and the
    fame he would thereby acquire on his return to the lake.</p>

    <p>Mischief seldom lacks opportunity, and shortly after this it
    happened that a young girl came down to the lake for water to
    wash with; and dipping her pail just above the Nix's head, in a
    moment he jumped in, and was brought safe to land. The maid was
    Bess, the washerwoman's daughter; and as she had had one good
    scolding that morning for oversleeping herself, and another
    about noon for dawdling with her work, she took up the pail and
    set off home without delay.</p>

    <p>But though she held it steadily enough, the bucket shook,
    and the water spilled hither and thither. Thinking that her
    right arm might be tired, she moved the weight to her left, but
    with no better success, for the water still spilled at every
    step. "One would think there were fishes in the pail," said
    Bess, as she set it down. But there was nothing to be seen but
    a thin red water-worm wriggling at the bottom, such as you may
    see any day in a soft-water tub. It was in this shape, however,
    that the Nix had disguised himself, and he almost writhed out
    of his skin with delight at the success of his first essay in
    mischief.</p>

    <p>When they once more set forward the Nix leaped and jumped
    harder than ever, so that not only was the water spilled, but
    the maiden's dress was soaked, and her tears dropped almost as
    fast as the wet dripped from her clothes.</p>

    <p>"The pail is bewitched!" cried the poor girl. "How my mother
    will beat me for this! And my back aches as if I were carrying
    lead, and yet the water is nearly all gone."</p>

    <p>"This is something like fun!" laughed the Nix. "When I go
    home and relate <i>my</i> adventures, no dwarfs pranks will be
    named again!" But when Bess looked into the pail, he was the
    same slimy, stupid-looking worm as before. She dared not return
    to the lake for more water&mdash;"for," said she, "I should be
    as much beaten for being late as for bringing short measure,
    and have the labour to boot." So she took up her burden again,
    and the Nix began his dance afresh, and by the time they came
    to their journey's end, there was not a quart of water in the
    pail.</p>

    <p>"Was ever a poor woman plagued with such a careless hussy?"
    cried the mother when she saw the dripping dress; and, as Bess
    had expected, she seasoned her complaints with a hearty slap.
    "And look what she calls a pailful of water!" added the mother,
    with a second blow.</p>

    <p>"Late in the morning's unlucky all day," thought poor Bess,
    and, as her mother curled her, she screamed till the house rang
    with the noise; for she had good lungs, and knew that it is
    well to cry out before one gets too much hurt.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the Nix thought she was enduring agonies, and
    could hardly contain his mischievous glee; and when the woman
    bade her "warm some water quickly for the wash," he was in no
    way disturbed, for he had never seen boiling water, and only
    anticipated fresh sport as he slipped from the pail into the
    kettle.</p>

    <p>"Now," cried the mother sharply, "see if you can lift
    <i>that</i> without slopping your clothes."</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye," laughed the Nix, "see if you can, my dear!" and
    as poor Bess seized it in her sturdy red hands he began to
    dance as before. But the kettle had a lid, which the pail had
    not. Moreover Bess was a strong, strapping lass, and,
    stimulated by the remembrance of her mother's slaps, with a
    vigorous effort she set the kettle on the fire. "I shall be
    glad when I'm safely in bed," she muttered. "Everything goes
    wrong to-day."</p>

    <p>"It is warm in here," said the Nix to himself, after a
    while; "in fact&mdash;stuffy. But one must pay something for a
    frolic, and it tickles my ears to hear that old woman rating
    her daughter for my pranks. Give me time and opportunity, and
    I'll set the whole stupid race by the ears. There she goes
    again! It is worth enduring a little discomfort, though it
    certainly is warm, and I fancy it grows warmer."</p>

    <p>By degrees the bottom of the kettle grew quite hot, and
    burnt the Nix, so that he had to jump up and down in the water
    to keep himself cool. The noise of this made the woman think
    that the kettle was boiling, and she began to scold her
    daughter as before, shouting, "Are you coming with that tub
    to-night or not? The water is hot already."</p>

    <p>This time the Nix laughed (as they say) on the other side of
    his mouth; for the water had now become as hot as the bottom of
    the kettle, and he screamed at the top of his shrill tiny voice
    with pain.</p>

    <p>"How the kettle sings to-night!" said Bess, "and how it
    rains!" she added. For at that moment a tremendous storm burst
    around the house, and the rain poured down in sheets of water,
    as if it meant to wash everything into the lake. The kettle now
    really boiled, and the lid danced up and down with the frantic
    leaping and jumping of the agonized Nix, who puffed and blew
    till his breath came out of the spout in clouds of steam.</p>

    <p>"If your eyes were as sharp as your ears you'd see that the
    water is boiling over," snapped the woman; and giving her
    daughter a passing push, she hurried to the fire-place, and
    lifted the kettle on to the ground.</p>

    <p>But no sooner had she set it down, than the lid flew off,
    and out jumped a little man with green teeth and a tall green
    hat, who ran out of the door wringing his hands and
    crying&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Three hundred and three years have I lived in the water of
    this lake, and I never knew it boil before!"</p>

    <p>As he crossed the threshold, a clap of thunder broke with
    what sounded like a peal of laughter from many voices, and then
    the storm ceased as suddenly as it had begun.</p>

    <p>The woman now saw how matters stood, and did not fail next
    morning to fasten an old horseshoe to the door of her house.
    And seeing that she had behaved unjustly to her daughter, she
    bought her the gayest set of pink ribbons that were to be found
    at the next fair.</p>

    <p>It is on record that Bess (who cared little for slaps and
    sharp speeches) thought this the best bargain she had ever
    made. But whether the Nix was equally well satisfied is not
    known.</p>

       id="THE_COBBLER_AND_THE_GHOSTS"></a>THE COBBLER AND THE
       GHOSTS.</h2>

    <p>Long ago there lived a cobbler who had very poor wits, but
    by strict industry he could earn enough to keep himself and his
    widowed mother in comfort.</p>

    <p>In this manner he had lived for many years in peace and
    prosperity, when a distant relative died who left him a certain
    sum of money. This so elated the cobbler that he could think of
    nothing else, and his only talk was of the best way of spending
    the legacy.</p>

    <p>His mother advised him to lay it by against a rainy day.</p>

    <p>"For," said she, "we have lived long in much comfort as we
    are, and have need of nothing; but when you grow old, or if it
    should please Heaven that you become disabled, you will then be
    glad of your savings."</p>

    <p>But to this the cobbler would not listen. "No," said he, "if
    we save the money it may be stolen, but if we spend it well, we
    shall have the use of what we buy, and may sell it again if we
    are so minded."</p>

    <p>He then proposed one purchase after another, and each was
    more foolish than the rest. When this had gone on for some
    time, one morning he exclaimed: "I have it at last! We will buy
    the house. It cannot be stolen or lost, and when it is ours we
    shall have no rent to pay, and I shall not have to work so
    hard."</p>

    <p>"He will never hit on a wiser plan than that," thought the
    widow; "it is not to be expected." So she fully consented to
    this arrangement, which was duly carried out; and the bargain
    left the cobbler with a few shillings, which he tied up in a
    bag and put in his pocket, having first changed them into
    pence, that they might make more noise when he jingled the bag
    as he walked down the street.</p>

    <p>Presently he said; "It is not fit that a man who lives in
    his own house, and has ready money in his pocket too, should
    spend the whole day in labouring with his hands. Since by good
    luck I can read, it would be well that I should borrow a book
    from the professor, for study is an occupation suitable to my
    present position."</p>

    <p>Accordingly, he went to the professor, whom he found seated
    in his library, and preferred his request.</p>

    <p>"What book do you want?" asked the professor.</p>

    <p>The cobbler stood and scratched his head thoughtfully. The
    professor thought that he was trying to recall the name of the
    work; but in reality he was saying to himself: "How much
    additional knowledge one requires if he has risen ever so
    little in life! Now, if I did but know where it is proper to
    begin in a case full of books like this! Should one take the
    first on the top shelf, or the bottom shelf, to the left, or to
    the right?"</p>

    <p>At last he resolved to choose the book nearest to him; so
    drawing it out from the rest, he answered&mdash;</p>

    <p>"This one, if it please you, learned sir." The professor
    lent it to him, and he took it home and began to read.</p>

    <p>It was, as it happened, a book about ghosts and apparitions;
    and the cobbler's mind was soon so full of these marvels that
    he could talk of nothing else, and hardly did a stroke of work
    for reading and pondering over what he read. He could find none
    of his neighbours who had seen a ghost, though most had heard
    of such things, and many believed in them.</p>

    <p>"Live and learn," thought the cobbler; "here is fame as well
    as wealth. If I could but see a ghost there would be no more to
    desire." And with this intent he sallied forth late one night
    to the churchyard.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile a thief (who had heard the jingle of his
    money-bag) resolved to profit by the cobbler's whim; so
    wrapping himself in a sheet, he laid wait for him in a field
    that he must cross to reach the church.</p>

    <p>When the cobbler saw the white figure, he made sure, that he
    had now seen a ghost, and already felt proud of his own
    acquaintance, as a remarkable character. Meanwhile, the thief
    stood quite still, and the cobbler walked boldly up to him,
    expecting that the phantom would either vanish or prove so
    impalpable that he could pass through it as through a mist, of
    which he had read many notable instances in the professor's
    book. He soon found out his mistake, however, for the supposed
    ghost grappled him, and without loss of time relieved him of
    his money-bag. The cobbler (who was not wanting in courage)
    fastened as tightly on to the sheet, which he still held with
    desperate firmness when the thief had slipped through his
    fingers; and after waiting in vain for further marvels, he
    carried the sheet home to his mother, and narrated his
    encounter with the ghost.</p>

    <p>"Alack-a-day! that I should have a son with so little wit!"
    cried the old woman; "it was no ghost, but a thief, who is now
    making merry with all the money we possessed."</p>

    <p>"We have his sheet," replied her son; "and that is due
    solely to my determination. How could I have acted better?"</p>

    <p>"You should have grasped the man, not the sheet," said the
    widow, "and pummelled him till he cried out and dropped the
    money-bag."</p>

    <p>"Live and learn," said the cobbler. The next night he went
    out as before, and this time reached the churchyard unmolested.
    He was just climbing the stile, when he again saw what seemed
    to be a white figure standing near the church. As before, it
    proved solid, and this time he pummelled it till his fingers
    bled, and for very weariness he was obliged to go home and
    relate his exploits. The ghost had not cried out, however, nor
    even so much as moved, for it was neither more nor less than a
    tall tombstone shining white in the moonlight.</p>

    <p>"Alack-a-day!" cried the old woman, "that I should have a
    son with so little wit as to beat a gravestone till his
    knuckles are sore! Now if he had covered it with something
    black that it might not alarm timid women or children, that
    would at least have been an act of charity."</p>

    <p>"Live and learn," said the cobbler. The following night he
    again set forth, but this time in another direction. As he was
    crossing a field behind his house he saw some long pieces of
    linen which his mother had put out to bleach in the dew.</p>

    <p>"More ghosts!" cried the shoemaker, "and they know who is
    behind them. They have fallen flat at the sound of my
    footsteps. But one must think of others as well as oneself, and
    it is not every heart that is as stout as mine." Saying which
    he returned to the house for something black to throw over the
    prostrate ghosts. Now the kitchen chimney had been swept that
    morning, and by the back door stood a sack of soot.</p>

    <p>"What is blacker than soot?" said the cobbler; and taking
    the sack, he shook it out over the pieces of linen till not a
    thread of white was to be seen. After which he went home, and
    boasted of his good deeds.</p>

    <p>The widow now saw that she must be more careful as to what
    she said; so, after weighing the matter for some time, she
    suggested to the cobbler that the next night he should watch
    for ghosts at home; "for they are to be seen," said she, "as
    well when one is in bed as in the fields."</p>

    <p>"There you are right," said the cobbler, "for I have this
    day read of a ghost that appeared to a man in his own house.
    The candles burnt blue, and when he had called thrice upon the
    apparition, he became senseless."</p>

    <p>"That was his mistake," said the old woman. "He should have
    turned a deaf ear, and even pretended to slumber; but it is not
    every one who has courage for this. If one could really fall
    asleep in the face of the apparition, there would be true
    bravery."</p>

    <p>"Leave that to me," said the cobbler. And the widow went off
    chuckling, to herself, "If he comes to any mischance by holding
    his tongue and going to sleep, ill-luck has got him by the leg,
    and counsel is wasted on him."</p>

    <p>As soon as his mother was in bed, the cobbler prepared for
    his watch. First he got together all the candles in the house,
    and stuck them here and there about the kitchen, and sat down
    to watch till they should burn blue. After waiting some time,
    during which the candles only guttered with the draughts, the
    cobbler decided to go to rest for a while. "It is too early
    yet," he thought; "I shall see nothing till midnight."</p>

    <p>Very soon, however, he fell asleep; but towards morning he
    awoke, and in the dim light perceived a figure in white at his
    bedside. It was a blacksmith who lived near, and he had run in
    in his night-shirt without so much as slippers on his feet.</p>

    <p>"The ghost at last!" thought the cobbler, and, remembering
    his mother's advice, he turned over and shut his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Neighbour! neighbour!" cried the blacksmith, "your house is
    on fire!"</p>

    <p>"An old bird is not to be caught with chaff," chuckled the
    cobbler to himself; and he pulled the bed-clothes over his
    head.</p>

    <p>"Neighbour!" roared the blacksmith, snatching at the quilt
    to drag it off, "are you mad? The house is burning over your
    head. Get up for your life!"</p>

    <p>"I have the courage of a general, and more," thought the
    cobbler; and holding tightly on to the clothes he pretended to
    snore.</p>

    <p>"If you will burn, bum!" cried the blacksmith angrily, "but
    I mean to save my bones"&mdash;with which he ran off.</p>

    <p>And burnt the cobbler undoubtedly would have been, had not
    his mother's cries at last convinced him that the candles had
    set fire to his house, which was wrapped in flames. With some
    difficulty he escaped with his life, but of all he possessed
    nothing remained to him but his tools and a few articles of
    furniture that the widow had saved.</p>

    <p>As he was now again reduced to poverty, he was obliged to
    work as diligently as in former years, and passed the rest of
    his days in the same peace and prosperity which he had before
    enjoyed.</p>

       id="THE_LAIRD_AND_THE_MAN_OF_PEACE"></a>THE LAIRD AND THE
       MAN OF PEACE.</h2>

    <p>In the Highlands of Scotland there once lived a Laird of
    Brockburn, who would not believe in fairies. Although his sixth
    cousin on the mother's side, as he returned one night from a
    wedding, had seen the Men of Peace hunting on the sides of Ben
    Muich Dhui, dressed in green, and with silver-mounted bridles
    to their horses which jingled as they rode; and though Rory the
    fiddler having gone to play at a christening did never come
    home, but crossing a hill near Brockburn in a mist was seduced
    into a <i>Shian</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1"
       id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1"
       class="fnanchor">[1]</a> or fairy turret, where, as all
       decent bodies well believe, he is playing still&mdash;in
       spite, I say, of the wise saws and experience of all his
       neighbours, Brockburn remained obstinately incredulous.</p>

    <p>Not that he bore any ill-will to the Good People, or spoke
    uncivilly of them; indeed he always disavowed any feeling of
    disrespect towards them if they existed, saying that he was a
    man of peace himself, and anxious to live peaceably with
    whatever neighbours he had, but that till he had seen one of
    the <i>Daoin Shi</i><a name="FNanchor_2_2"
       id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2"
       class="fnanchor">[2]</a> he could not believe in them.</p>

    <p>Now one afternoon, between Hallowmas and Yule, it chanced
    that the Laird, being out on the hills looking for some cattle,
    got parted from his men and dogs and was overtaken by a mist,
    in which, familiar as the country was to him, he lost his
    way.</p>

    <p>In vain he raised his voice high, and listened low, no sound
    of man or beast came back to him through the thickening
    vapour.</p>

    <p>Then night fell, and darkness was added to the fog, so that
    Brockburn needed to sound every step with his
    <i>rung</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3"
       id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3"
       class="fnanchor">[3]</a> before he took it.</p>

    <p>Suddenly light footsteps pattered beside him, then Something
    rubbed against him, then It ran between his legs. The delighted
    Laird made sure that his favourite collie had found him once
    more.</p>

    <p>"Wow, Jock, man!" he cried; "but ye needna throw me on my
    face. What's got ye the night, that <i>you</i> should lose your
    way in a bit mist?"</p>

    <p>To this a voice from the level of his elbow replied, in
    piping but patronizing tones;</p>

    <p>"Never did I lose my way in a mist since the night that Finn
    crossed over to Ireland in the Dawn of History. Eh, Laird! I'm
    weel acquaint with every bit path on the hill-side these
    hundreds of years, and I'll guide ye safe hame, never
    fear!"</p>

    <p>The hairs on Brockburn's head stood on end till they lifted
    his broad bonnet, and a damp chill broke out over him that was
    not the fog. But, for all that, he stoutly resisted the
    evidence of his senses, and only felt about him for the
    collie's head to pat, crying:</p>

    <p>"Bark! Jock, my mannie, bark! Then I'll recognize your
    voice, ye ken. It's no canny to hear ye speak like a Christian,
    my wee doggie."</p>

    <p>"I'm nae your doggie, I'm a Man of Peace," was the reply.
    "Dinna miscall your betters, Brockburn: why will ye not credit
    our existence, man?"</p>

    <p>"Seein's believin'," said the Laird, stubbornly; "but the
    mist's ower thick for seein' the night, ye ken."</p>

    <p>"Turn roun' to your left, man, and ye'll see," said the
    Dwarf, and catching Brockburn by the arm, he twisted him
    swiftly round three times, when a sudden blaze of light poured
    through the mist, and revealed a crag of the mountain well
    known to the Laird, and which he now saw to be a kind of
    turret, or tower.</p>

    <p>Lights shone gaily through the crevices or windows of the
    <i>Shian</i>, and sounds of revelry came forth, among which
    fiddling was conspicuous. The tune played at that moment was
    "Delvyn-side."</p>

    <p>Blinded by the light, and amazed at what he saw, the Laird
    staggered, and was silent.</p>

    <p>"Keep to your feet, man&mdash;keep to your feet!" said the
    Dwarf, laughing. "I doubt ye're fou, Brockburn!"</p>

    <p>"I'm nae fou," said the Laird, slowly, his rung grasped
    firmly in his hand, and his bonnet set back from his face,
    which was deadly pale. "But&mdash;man-<i>is yon Rory?</i> I'd
    know his fiddle in a thousand."</p>

    <p>"Ask no questions, and ye'll be tellt no lees," said the
    Dwarf. Then stepping up to the door of the <i>Shian</i>, he
    stood so that the light from within fell full upon him, and the
    astonished Laird saw a tiny but well-proportioned man, with
    delicate features, and golden hair flowing over his shoulders.
    He wore a cloak of green cloth, lined with daisies, and had
    silver shoes. His beautiful face quivered with amusement, and
    he cried triumphantly, "D'ye see me?&mdash;d'ye see me noo,
    Brockburn?"</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye," said the Laird; "and seein's believin'."</p>

    <p>"Then roun' wi' ye!" shouted the Man of Peace; and once more
    seizing the Laird by the arm, he turned him swiftly
    round&mdash;this time, to the right&mdash;and at the third turn
    the light vanished, and Brockburn and the Man of Peace were
    once more alone together in the mist.</p>

    <p>"Aweel, Brockburn," said the Man of Peace, "I'll alloo ye're
    candid, and have a convincible mind. I'm no ill disposit to ye,
    and yese get safe hame, man."</p>

    <p>As he spoke he stooped down, and picking up half-a-dozen big
    stones from the mountain-side, he gave them to the Laird,
    saying, "If the gudewife asks ye about the bit stanes, say ye
    got them in a compliment."<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
       id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
       class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

    <p>Brockburn put them into his pocket, briefly saying, "I'm
    obleeged to ye;" but as he followed the Man of Peace down the
    hill-side, he found the obligation so heavy, that from time to
    time he threw a stone away, unobserved, as he hoped, by his
    companion. When the first stone fell, the Man of Peace looked
    sharply round, saying:</p>

    <p>"What's yon?"</p>

    <p>"It'll be me striking my rung upon the ground," said the
    Laird.</p>

    <p>"You're mad," said the Man of Peace, and Brockburn felt sure
    that he knew the truth, and was displeased. But as they went
    on, the stones were so heavy, and bumped the Laird's side so
    hard, that he threw away a second, dropping it as gently as he
    could. But the sound of its fall did not escape the ears of the
    Man of Peace, who cried as before:</p>

    <p>"What's yon?"</p>

    <p>"It's jest a nasty hoast<a name="FNanchor_5_5"
       id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5"
       class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that I have," said the Laird.</p>

    <p>"Man, you're daft," said the Dwarf, contemptuously; "that's
    what ails ye."</p>

    <p>The Laird now resolved to be prudent, but the inconvenience
    of his burden was so great that after a while he resolved to
    risk the displeasure of the Man of Peace once more, and gently
    slipped a third stone to the ground.</p>

    <p>"Third time's lucky," he thought. But the proverb failed
    him, for the Dwarf turned as before, shouting: "What's
    yon?"</p>

    <p>"It'll be my new brogues<a name="FNanchor_6_6"
       id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"
       class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that ye hear bumpin' Upon the
       muckle stanes," said the Laird.</p>

    <p>"Ye're fou, Brockburn, I tellt ye so. Ye're fou!" growled
    the Man of Peace, angrily, and the Laird dared not drop any
    more of the Dwarfs gifts. After a while his companion's
    good-humour seemed to return, and he became talkative and
    generous.</p>

    <p>"I mind your great-grandfather weel, Brockburn. He was a
    hamely man, I found his sheep for him one nicht on this verra
    hill-side. Mair by token, ye'll find your beasties at hame, and
    the men and the dogs forebye."</p>

    <p>The Laird thanked him heartily, and after a while the Dwarf
    became more liberal-spirited still.</p>

    <p>"Yese no have to say that ye've been with the <i>Daoin
    Shi</i> and are no the better for it," he said. "I'm thinking
    I'll grant ye three wushes. But choose wisely, man, and dinna
    throw <i>them</i> away. I hae my fears that ye're no without a
    bee in your bonnet, Brockburn."</p>

    <p>Incensed by this insinuation, the Laird defended his own
    sagacity at some length, and retorted on his companion with
    doubts of the power of the <i>Daoin Shi</i> to grant
    wishes.</p>

    <p>"The proof of the pudding's in the eating o't," said the Man
    of Peace. "Wush away, Brockburn, and mak the nut as hard to
    crack as ye will."</p>

    <p>The Laird at once began to cast about in his mind for three
    wishes sufficiently comprehensive to secure his lifelong
    prosperity; but the more he beat his brains the less could he
    satisfy himself.</p>

    <p>How many miles he wandered thus, the Dwarf keeping silently
    beside him, he never knew, before he sank exhausted on the
    ground, saying:</p>

    <p>"I'm thinking, man, that if ye could bring hame to me, in
    place of bringing me hame, I'd misdoubt your powers nae mair.
    It's a far cry to Loch Awe,<a name="FNanchor_7_7"
       id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
       class="fnanchor">[7]</a> ye ken, and it's a weary long road
       to Brockburn."</p>

    <p>"Is this your wush?" asked the Man of Peace.</p>

    <p>"This is my wush," said the Laird, striking his rung upon
    the ground.</p>

    <p>The words had scarcely passed his lips when the whole
    homestead of Brockburn, house and farm buildings, was planted
    upon the bleak hill-side.</p>

    <p>The astonished Laird now began to bewail the rash wish which
    had removed his home from the sheltered and fertile valley
    where it originally stood to the barren side of a bleak
    mountain.</p>

    <p>The Man of Peace, however, would not take any hints as to
    undoing his work of his own accord. All he said was:</p>

    <p>"If ye wush it away, so it'll be. But then ye'll only have
    one wush left. Ye've small discretion the nicht, Brockburn, I'm
    feared."</p>

    <p>"To leave the steading in sic a spot is no to be thought
    on," sighed the Laird, as he spent his second wish in undoing
    his first. But he cannily added the provision:</p>

    <p>"And ye may tak me wi' it."</p>

    <p>The words were no sooner spoken than the homestead was back
    in its place, and Brockburn himself was lying in his own bed,
    Jock, his favourite collie, barking and licking his face by
    turns for joy.</p>

    <p>"Whisht, whisht, Jock!" said the Laird. "Ye wouldna bark
    when I begged of ye, so ye may hand your peace noo."</p>

    <p>And pushing the collie from him, he sat up in bed and looked
    anxiously but vainly round the chamber for the Man of
    Peace.</p>

    <p>"Lie doun, lie doun," cried the gudewife from beside him.
    "Ye're surely out o' your wuts, Brockburn. Would ye gang
    stravaging about the country again the nicht?"</p>

    <p>"Where is he?" cried the Laird.</p>

    <p>"There's not a soul here but your lawful wife and your ain
    dear doggie. Was there ae body that ye expected?" asked his
    wife.</p>

    <p>"The Man o' Peace, woman!" cried Brockburn. "I've ane o' my
    wushes to get, and I maun hae't."</p>

    <p>"The man's mad!" was the gudewife's comment. "Ye've surely
    forgotten yoursel, Brockburn. Ye never believed in the
    <i>Daoin Shi</i> before."</p>

    <p>"Seein's believin'," said the Laird. "I forgathered with a
    Man o' Peace the nicht on the hill, and I wush I just saw him
    again."</p>

    <p>As the Laird spoke the window of the chamber was lit up from
    without, and the Man of Peace appeared sitting on the
    window-ledge in his daisy-lined cloak, his feet hanging down
    into the room, the silver shoes glittering as they dangled.</p>

    <p>"I'm here, Brockburn!" he cried. "But eh, man! ye've had
    your last wush."</p>

    <p>And even as the stupefied Laird gazed, the light slowly died
    away, and the Man of Peace vanished also.</p>

    <p>On the following morning the Laird was roused from sleep by
    loud cries of surprise and admiration.</p>

    <p>The good wife had been stirring for some hours, and in
    emptying the pockets of her good man's coat she had found three
    huge cairngorms of exquisite tint and lustre. Brockburn thus
    discovered the value of the gifts, half of which he had thrown
    away.</p>

    <p>But no subsequent visits to the hill-side led to their
    recovery. Many a time did the Laird bring home a heavy
    pocketful of stones, at the thrifty gude-wife's bidding, but
    they only proved to be the common stones of the mountain-side.
    The <i>Shian</i> could never be distinguished from any other

    <p>Yet it is said that the Laird of Brockburn prospered and
    throve thereafter, in acre, stall, and steading, as those
    seldom prosper who have not the good word of the People of
    Peace.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_OGRE_COURTING"
       id="THE_OGRE_COURTING"></a>THE OGRE COURTING.</h2>

    <p>In days when ogres were still the terror of certain
    districts, there was one who had long kept a whole
    neighbourhood in fear without any one daring to dispute his
    tyranny.</p>

    <p>By thefts and exactions, by heavy ransoms from merchants too
    old and tough to be eaten, in one way and another, the Ogre had
    become very rich; and although those who knew could tell of
    huge cellars full of gold and jewels, and yards and barns
    groaning with the weight of stolen goods, the richer he grew
    the more anxious and covetous he became. Moreover, day by day,
    he added to his stores; for though (like most ogres) he was as
    stupid as he was strong, no one had ever been found, by force
    or fraud, to get the better of him.</p>

    <p>What he took from the people was not their heaviest
    grievance. Even to be killed and eaten by him was not the
    chance they thought of most. A man can die but once; and if he
    is a sailor, a shark may eat him, which is not so much better
    than being devoured by an ogre. No, that was not the worst. The
    worst was this&mdash;he would keep getting married. And as he
    liked little wives, all the short women lived in fear and
    dread. And as his wives always died very soon, he was
    constantly courting fresh ones.</p>

    <p>Some said he ate his wives; some said he tormented, and
    others, that he only worked them to death. Everybody knew it
    was not a desirable match, and yet there was not a father who
    dare refuse his daughter if she were asked for. The Ogre only
    cared for two things in a woman&mdash;he liked her to be
    little, and a good housewife.</p>

    <p>Now it was when the Ogre had just lost his twenty-fourth
    wife (within the memory of man) that these two qualities were
    eminently united in the person of the smallest and most notable
    woman of the district, the daughter of a certain poor farmer.
    He was so poor that he could not afford properly to dower his
    daughter, who had in consequence remained single beyond her
    first youth. Everybody felt sure that Managing Molly must now
    be married to the Ogre. The tall girls stretched themselves
    till they looked like maypoles, and said, "Poor thing!" The
    slatterns gossiped from house to house, the heels of their
    shoes clacking as they went, and cried that this was what came
    of being too thrifty.</p>

    <p>And sure enough, in due time, the giant widower came to the
    farmer as he was in the field looking over his crops, and
    proposed for Molly there and then. The farmer was so much put
    out that he did not know what he said in reply, either when he
    was saying it, or afterwards, when his friends asked about it.
    But he remembered that the Ogre had invited himself to sup at
    the farm that day week.</p>

    <p>Managing Molly did not distress herself at the news.</p>

    <p>"Do what I bid you, and say as I say," said she to her
    father, "and if the Ogre does not change his mind, at any rate
    you shall not come empty-handed out of the business."</p>

    <p>By his daughter's desire the farmer now procured a large
    number of hares, and a barrel of white wine, which expenses
    completely emptied his slender stocking, and on the day of the
    Ogre's visit, she made a delicious and savoury stew with the
    hares in the biggest pickling tub, and the wine-barrel was set
    on a bench near the table.</p>

    <p>When the Ogre came, Molly served up the stew, and the Ogre
    sat down to sup, his head just touching the kitchen rafters.
    The stew was perfect, and there was plenty of it. For what
    Molly and her father ate was hardly to be counted in the
    tubful. The Ogre was very much pleased, and said politely:</p>

    <p>"I'm afraid, my dear, that you have been put to great
    trouble and expense on my account, I have a large appetite, and
    like to sup well."</p>

    <p>"Don't mention it, sir," said Molly. "The fewer rats the
    more corn. How do <i>you</i> cook them?"</p>

    <p>"Not one of all the extravagant hussies I have had as wives
    ever cooked them at all," said the Ogre; and he thought to
    himself, "Such a stew out of rats! What frugality! What a
    housewife!"</p>

    <p>When he broached the wine, he was no less pleased, for it
    was of the best.</p>

    <p>"This, at any rate, must have cost you a great deal,
    neighbour," said he, drinking the farmer's health as Molly left
    the room.</p>

    <p>"I don't know that rotten apples could be better used," said
    the farmer; "but I leave all that to Molly. Do you brew at
    home?"</p>

    <p>"We give <i>our</i> rotten apples to the pigs," growled the
    Ogre. "But things will be better ordered when she is my
    wife."</p>

    <p>The Ogre was now in great haste to conclude the match, and
    asked what dowry the farmer would give his daughter.</p>

    <p>"I should never dream of giving a dowry with Molly," said
    the farmer, boldly. "Whoever gets her, gets dowry enough. On
    the contrary, I shall expect a good round sum from the man who
    deprives me of her. Our wealthiest farmer is just widowed, and
    therefore sure to be in a hurry for marriage. He has an eye to
    the main chance, and would not grudge to pay well for such a
    wife, I'll warrant."</p>

    <p>"I'm no churl myself," said the Ogre, who was anxious to
    secure his thrifty bride at any price; and he named a large sum
    of money, thinking, "We shall live on rats henceforward, and
    the beef and mutton will soon cover the dowry."</p>

    <p>"Double that, and we'll see," said the farmer, stoutly.</p>

    <p>But the Ogre became angry, and cried; "What are you thinking
    of, man? Who is to hinder my carrying your lass off, without
    'with your leave' or 'by your leave,' dowry or none?"</p>

    <p>"How little you know her!" said the farmer. "She is so firm
    that she would be cut to pieces sooner than give you any
    benefit of her thrift, unless you dealt fairly in the
    matter."</p>

    <p>"Well, well," said the Ogre, "let us meet each other." And
    he named a sum larger than he at first proposed, and less than
    the farmer had asked. This the farmer agreed to, as it was
    enough to make him prosperous for life.</p>

    <p>"Bring it in a sack to-morrow morning," said he to the Ogre,
    "and then you can speak to Molly; she's gone to bed now."</p>

    <p>The next morning, accordingly, the Ogre appeared, carrying
    the dowry in a sack, and Molly came to meet him.</p>

    <p>"There are two things," said she, "I would ask of any lover
    of mine: a new farmhouse, built as I should direct, with a view
    to economy; and a feather-bed of fresh goose feathers, filled
    when the old woman plucks her geese. If I don't sleep well, I
    cannot work well."</p>

    <p>"That is better than asking for finery," thought the Ogre;
    "and after all the house will be my own." So, to save the
    expense of labour, he built it himself, and worked hard, day
    after day, under Molly's orders, till winter came. Then it was
    finished.</p>

    <p>"Now for the feather-bed," said Molly. "I'll sew up the
    ticking, and when the old woman plucks her geese, I'll let you
    know."</p>

    <p>When it snows, they say the old woman up yonder is plucking
    her geese, and so at the first snowstorm Molly sent for the
    Ogre.</p>

    <p>"Now you see the feathers falling," said she, "so fill the
    bed."</p>

    <p>"How am I to catch them?" cried the Ogre.</p>

    <p>"Stupid! don't you see them lying there in a heap?" cried
    Molly; "get a shovel, and set to work."</p>

    <p>The Ogre accordingly carried in shovelfuls of snow to the
    bed, but as it melted as fast as he put it in, his labour never
    seemed done. Towards night the room got so cold that the snow
    would not melt, and now the bed was soon filled.</p>

    <p>Molly hastily covered it with sheets and blankets, and said:
    "Pray rest here to-night, and tell me if the bed is not comfort
    itself. To-morrow we will be married."</p>

    <p>So the tired Ogre lay down on the bed he had filled, but, do
    what he would, he could not get warm.</p>

    <p>"The sheets must be damp," said he, and in the morning he
    woke with such horrible pains in his bones that he could hardly
    move, and half the bed had melted away. "It's no use," he
    groaned, "she's a very managing woman, but to sleep on such a
    bed would be the death of me." And he went off home as quickly
    as he could, before Managing Molly could call upon him to be
    married; for she was so managing that he was more than half
    afraid of her already.</p>

    <p>When Molly found that he had gone, she sent the farmer after
    him.</p>

    <p>"What does he want?" cried the Ogre, when they told him the
    farmer was at the door.</p>

    <p>"He says the bride is waiting for you," was the reply.</p>

    <p>"Tell him I'm too ill to be married," said the Ogre.</p>

    <p>But the messenger soon returned:</p>

    <p>"He says she wants to know what you will give her to make up
    for the disappointment."</p>

    <p>"She's got the dowry, and the farm, and the feather-bed,"
    groaned the Ogre; "what more does she want?"</p>

    <p>But again the messenger returned:</p>

    <p>"She says you've pressed the feather-bed flat, and she wants
    some more goose feathers."</p>

    <p>"There are geese enough in the yard," yelled the Ogre, "Let
    him drive them home; and if he has another word to say, put him
    down to roast."</p>

    <p>The farmer, who overheard this order, lost no time in taking
    his leave, and as he passed through the yard he drove home as
    fine a flock of geese as you will see on a common.</p>

    <p>It is said that the Ogre never recovered from the effects of
    sleeping on the old woman's goose feathers, and was less
    powerful than before.</p>

    <p>As for Managing Molly, being now well dowered, she had no
    lack of offers of marriage, and was soon mated to her mind.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_MAGICIANS_GIFTS"
       id="THE_MAGICIANS_GIFTS"></a>THE MAGICIANS' GIFTS.</h2>

    <p>There was once a king in whose dominions lived no less than
    three magicians.</p>

    <p>When the king's eldest son was christened, the king invited
    the three magicians to the christening feast, and to make the
    compliment the greater, he asked one of them to stand
    godfather. But the other two, who were not asked to be
    godfathers, were so angry at what they held to be a slight,
    that they only waited to see how they might best revenge
    themselves upon the infant prince.</p>

    <p>When the moment came for presenting the christening gifts,
    the godfather magician advanced to the cradle and said, "My
    gift is this: Whatever he wishes for he shall have. And only I
    who give shall be able to recall this gift." For he perceived
    the jealousy of the other magicians, and knew that, if
    possible, they would undo what he did. But the second magician
    muttered in his beard, "And yet I will change it to a curse."
    And coming up to the cradle, he said, "The wishes that he has
    thus obtained he shall not be able to revoke or change."</p>

    <p>Then the third magician grumbled beneath his black robe, "If
    he were very wise and prudent he might yet be happy. But I will
    secure his punishment." So he also drew near to the cradle, and
    said, "For my part, I give him a hasty temper."</p>

    <p>After which, the two dissatisfied magicians withdrew
    together, saying, "Should we permit ourselves to be slighted
    for nothing?"</p>

    <p>But the king and his courtiers were not at all
    disturbed.</p>

    <p>"My son has only to be sure of what he wants," said the
    king, "and then, I suppose, he will not desire to recall his
    wishes."</p>

    <p>And the courtiers added, "If a prince may not have a hasty
    temper, who may, we should like to know?"</p>

    <p>And everybody laughed, except the godfather magician, who
    went out sighing and shaking his head, and was seen no
    more.</p>

    <p>Whilst the king's son was yet a child, the gift of the
    godfather magician began to take effect. There was nothing so
    rare and precious that he could not obtain it, or so difficult
    that it could not be accomplished by his mere wish. But, on the
    other hand, no matter how inconsiderately he spoke, or how
    often he changed his mind, what he had once wished must remain
    as he had wished it, in spite of himself; and as he often
    wished for things that were bad for him, and oftener still
    wished for a thing one day and regretted it the next, his power
    was the source of quite as much pain as pleasure to him. Then
    his temper was so hot, that he was apt hastily to wish ill to
    those who offended him, and afterwards bitterly to regret the
    mischief that he could not undo. Thus, one after another, the
    king appointed his trustiest counsellors to the charge of his
    son, who, sooner or later, in the discharge of their duty, were
    sure to be obliged to thwart him; on which the impatient prince
    would cry, "I wish you were at the bottom of the sea with your
    rules and regulations;" and the counsellors disappeared
    accordingly, and returned no more.</p>

    <p>When there was not a wise man left at court, and the king
    himself lived in daily dread of being the next victim, he said,
    "Only one thing remains to be done: to find the godfather
    magician, and persuade him to withdraw his gift."</p>

    <p>So the king offered rewards, and sent out messengers in
    every direction, but the magician was not to be found. At last,
    one day he met a blind beggar, who said to him, "Three nights
    ago I dreamed that I went by the narrowest of seven roads to
    seek what you are looking for, and was successful."</p>

    <p>When the king returned home, he asked his courtiers, "Where
    are there seven roads lying near to each other, some broad, and
    some narrow?" And one of them replied, "Twenty-one miles to the
    west of the palace is a four-cross road, where three
    field-paths also diverge."</p>

    <p>To this place the king made his way, and taking the
    narrowest of the field-paths, went on and on till it led him
    straight into a cave, where an old woman sat over a fire.</p>

    <p>"Does a magician live here?" asked the king.</p>

    <p>"No one lives here but myself," said the old woman. "But as
    I am a wise woman I may be able to help you if you need
    it."</p>

    <p>The king then told her of his perplexities, and how he was
    desirous of finding the magician, to persuade him to recall his
    gift.</p>

    <p>"He could not recall the other gifts," said the wise woman.
    "Therefore it is better that the prince should be taught to use
    his power prudently and to control his temper. And since all
    the persons capable of guiding him have disappeared, I will
    return with you and take charge of him myself. Over me he will
    have no power."</p>

    <p>To this the king consented, and they returned together to
    the palace, where the wise woman became guardian to the prince,
    and she fulfilled her duties so well that he became much more
    discreet and self-controlled. Only at times his violent temper
    got the better of him, and led him to wish what he afterwards
    vainly regretted.</p>

    <p>Thus all went well till the prince became a man, when,
    though he had great affection for her, he felt ashamed of
    having an old woman for his counsellor, and he said, "I
    certainly wish that I had a faithful and discreet adviser of my
    own age and sex."</p>

    <p>On that very day a young nobleman offered himself as
    companion to the prince, and as he was a young man of great
    ability, he was accepted: whereupon the old woman took her
    departure, and was never seen again.</p>

    <p>The young nobleman performed his part so well that the
    prince became deeply attached to him, and submitted in every
    way to his counsels. But at last a day came when, being in a
    rage, the advice of his friend irritated him, and he cried
    hastily, "Will you drive me mad with your long sermons? I wish
    you would hold your tongue for ever." On which the young
    nobleman became dumb, and so remained. For he was not, as the
    wise woman had been, independent of the prince's power.</p>

    <p>The prince's grief and remorse knew no bounds. "Am I not
    under a curse?" said he. "Truly I ought to be cast out from
    human society, and sent to live with wild beasts in a
    wilderness. I only bring evil upon those I love
    best&mdash;indeed, there is no hope for me unless I can find my
    godfather, and make him recall this fatal gift."</p>

    <p>So the prince mounted his horse, and, accompanied by his
    dumb friend, who still remained faithful to him, he set forth
    to find the magician. They took no followers, except the
    prince's dog, a noble hound, who was so quick of hearing that
    he understood all that was said to him, and was, next to the
    young nobleman, the wisest person at court.</p>

    <p>"Mark well, my dog," said the prince to him, "we stay
    nowhere till we find my godfather, and when we find him we go
    no further. I rely on your sagacity to help us."</p>

    <p>The dog licked the prince's hand, and then trotted so
    resolutely down a certain road that the two friends allowed him
    to lead them and followed close behind.</p>

    <p>They travelled in this way to the edge of the king's
    dominions, only halting for needful rest and refreshment. At
    last the dog led them through a wood, and towards evening they
    found themselves in the depths of the forest, with no sign of
    any shelter for the night. Presently they heard a little bell,
    such as is rung for prayer, and the dog ran down a side path
    and led them straight to a kind of grotto, at the door of which
    stood an aged hermit.</p>

    <p>"Does a magician live here?" asked the prince.</p>

    <p>"No one lives here but myself," said the hermit, "but I am
    old, and have meditated much. My advice is at your service if
    you need it."</p>

    <p>The prince then related his history, and how he was now
    seeking the magician godfather, to rid himself of his gift.</p>

    <p>"And yet that will not cure your temper," said the hermit.
    "It were better that you employed yourself in learning to
    control that, and to use your power prudently."</p>

    <p>"No, no," replied the prince; "I must find the
    magician."</p>

    <p>And when the hermit pressed his advice, he cried, "Provoke
    me not, good father, or I may be base enough to wish you ill;
    and the evil I do I cannot undo."</p>

    <p>And he departed, followed by his friend, and calling his
    dog. But the dog seated himself at the hermit's feet, and would
    not move. Again and again the prince called him, but he only
    whined and wagged his tail, and refused to move. Coaxing and
    scolding were both in vain, and when at last the prince tried
    to drag him off by force, the dog growled.</p>

    <p>"Base brute!" cried the prince, flinging him from him in a
    transport of rage. "How have I been so deceived in you? I wish
    you were hanged!" And even as he spoke the dog vanished, and as
    the prince turned his head he saw the poor beast's body
    dangling from a tree above him. The sight overwhelmed him, and
    he began bitterly to lament his cruelty.</p>

    <p>"Will no one hang me also," he cried, "and rid the world of
    such a monster?"</p>

    <p>"It is easier to die repenting than to live amending," said
    the hermit; "yet is the latter course the better one. Wherefore
    abide with me, my son, and learn in solitude those lessons of
    self-government without which no man is fit to rule
    others."</p>

    <p>"It is impossible," said the prince. "These fits of passion
    are as a madness that comes upon me, and they are beyond cure.
    It only remains to find my godfather, that he may make me less
    baneful to others by taking away the power I abuse." And
    raising the body of the dog tenderly in his arms, he laid it
    before him on his horse, and rode away, the dumb nobleman
    following him.</p>

    <p>They now entered the dominions of another king, and in due
    time arrived at the capital. The prince presented himself to
    the king, and asked if he had a magician in his kingdom.</p>

    <p>"Not to my knowledge," replied the king. "But I have a
    remarkably wise daughter, and if you want counsel she may be
    able to help you."</p>

    <p>The princess accordingly was sent for, and she was so
    beautiful, as well as witty, that the prince fell in love with
    her, and begged the king to give her to him to wife. The king,
    of course, was unable to refuse what the prince wished, and the
    wedding was celebrated without delay; and by the advice of his
    wife the prince placed the body of his faithful dog in a glass
    coffin, and kept it near him, that he might constantly be
    reminded of the evil results of giving way to his anger.</p>

    <p>For a time all went well. At first the prince never said a
    harsh word to his wife; but by and by familiarity made him less
    careful, and one day she said something that offended him, and
    he fell into a violent rage. As he went storming up and down,
    the princess wrung her hands, and cried, "Ah, my dear husband,
    I beg of you to be careful what you say to me. You say you
    loved your dog, and yet you know where he lies."</p>

    <p>"I know that I wish you were with him, with your prating!"
    cried the prince, in a fury; and the words were scarcely out of
    his mouth when the princess vanished from his side, and when he
    ran to the glass coffin, there she lay, pale and lifeless, with
    her head upon the body of the hound.</p>

    <p>The prince was now beside himself with remorse and misery,
    and when the dumb nobleman made signs that they should pursue
    their search for the magician, he only cried, "Too late! too
    late!"</p>

    <p>But after a while he said, "I will return to the hermit, and
    pass the rest of my miserable life in solitude and penance. And
    you, dear friend, go back to my father."</p>

    <p>But the dumb nobleman shook his head, and could not be
    persuaded to leave the prince. Then they took the glass coffin
    on their shoulders, and on foot, and weeping as they went, they
    retraced their steps to the forest.</p>

    <p>For some time the prince remained with the hermit, and
    submitted himself to his direction. Then the hermit bade him
    return to his father, and he obeyed.</p>

    <p>Every day the prince stood by the glass coffin, and beat his
    breast and cried, "Behold, murderer, the fruits of anger!" And
    he tried hard to overcome the violence of his temper. When he
    lost heart he remembered a saying of the hermit: "Patience had
    far to go, but she was crowned at last." And after a while the
    prince became as gentle as he had before been violent. And the
    king and all the court rejoiced at the change; but the prince
    remained sad at heart, thinking of the princess.</p>

    <p>One day he was sitting alone, when a man approached him,
    dressed in a long black robe.</p>

    <p>"Good-day, godson," said he.</p>

    <p>"Who calls me godson?" said the prince.</p>

    <p>"The magician you have so long sought," said the godfather.
    "I have come to reclaim my gift."</p>

    <p>"What cruelty led you to bestow it upon me?" asked the
    prince.</p>

    <p>"The king, your father, would have been dissatisfied with
    any ordinary present from me," said the magician, "forgetting
    that the responsibilities of common gifts, and very limited
    power, are more than enough for most men to deal with. But I
    have not neglected you. I was the wise woman who brought you
    up. Again, I was the hermit, as your dog was sage enough to
    discover. I am come now to reclaim what has caused you such
    suffering."</p>

    <p>"Alas!" cried the prince, "why is your kindness so tardy? If
    you have not forgotten me, why have you withheld this benefit
    till it is too late for my happiness? My friend is dumb, my
    wife is dead, my dog is hanged. When wishes cannot reach these,
    do you think it matters to me what I may command?"</p>

    <p>"Softly, prince," said the magician; "I had a reason for the
    delay. But for these bitter lessons you would still be the
    slave of the violent temper which you have conquered, and
    which, as it was no gift of mine, I could not remove. Moreover,
    when the spell which made all things bend to your wish is taken
    away, its effects also are undone. Godson! I recall my
    gift."</p>

    <p>As the magician spoke the glass sides of the coffin melted
    into the air, and the princess sprang up, and threw herself
    into her husband's arms. The dog also rose, stretched himself,
    and wagged his tail. The dumb nobleman ran to tell the good
    news to the king, and all the counsellors came back in a long
    train from the bottom of the sea, and set about the affairs of
    state as if nothing had happened.</p>

    <p>The old king welcomed his children with open arms, and they
    all lived happily to the end of their days.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_WIDOWS_AND_THE_STRANGERS"
       id="THE_WIDOWS_AND_THE_STRANGERS"></a>THE WIDOWS AND THE
       STRANGERS.</h2>

    <p>In days of yore, there were once two poor old widows who
    lived in the same hamlet and under the same roof. But though
    the cottages joined and one roof covered them, they had each a
    separate dwelling; and although they were alike in age and
    circumstances, yet in other respects they were very different.
    For one dame was covetous, though she had little to save, and
    the other was liberal, though she had little to give.</p>

    <p>Now, on the rising ground opposite to the widows' cottages,
    stood a monastery where a few pious and charitable brethren
    spent their time in prayer, labour, and good works. And with
    the alms of these monks, and the kindness of neighbours, and
    because their wants were few, the old women dwelt in comfort,
    and had daily bread, and lay warm at night.</p>

    <p>One evening, when the covetous old widow was having supper,
    there came a knock at her door. Before she opened it she
    hastily put away the remains of her meal.</p>

    <p>"For," said she, "it is a stormy night, and ten to one some
    belated vagabond wants shelter; and when there are victuals on
    the table every fool must be asked to sup."</p>

    <p>But when she opened the door, a monk came in who had his
    cowl pulled over his head to shelter him from the storm. The
    widow was much disconcerted at having kept one of the
    brotherhood waiting, and loudly apologized, but the monk
    stopped her, saying, "I fear I cut short your evening meal, my
    daughter."</p>

    <p>"Now in the name of ill-luck, how came he to guess that?"
    thought the widow, as with anxious civility she pressed the
    monk to take some supper after his walk; for the good woman
    always felt hospitably inclined towards any one who was likely
    to return her kindness sevenfold.</p>

    <p>The brother, however, refused to sup; and as he seated
    himself the widow looked sharply through her spectacles to see
    if she could gather from any distention of the folds of his
    frock whether a loaf, a bottle of cordial, or a new winter's
    cloak were most likely to crown the visit. No undue
    protuberance being visible about the monk's person, she turned
    her eyes to his face, and found that her visitor was one of the
    brotherhood whom she had not seen before. And not only was his
    face unfamiliar, it was utterly unlike the kindly but rough
    countenances of her charitable patrons. None that she had ever
    seen boasted the noble beauty, the chiselled and refined
    features of the monk before her. And she could not but notice
    that, although only one rushlight illumined her room, and
    though the monk's cowl went far to shade him even from that,
    yet his face was lit up as if by light from within, so that his
    clear skin seemed almost transparent. In short, her curiosity
    must have been greatly stirred, had not greed made her more
    anxious to learn what he had brought than who he was.</p>

    <p>"It's a terrible night," quoth the monk, at length. "Such
    tempest without only gives point to the indoor comforts of the
    wealthy; but it chills the very marrow of the poor and
    destitute."</p>

    <p>"Aye, indeed," sniffed the widow, with a shiver. "If it were
    not for the charity of good Christians, what would poor folk do
    for comfort on such an evening as this?"</p>

    <p>"It was that very thought, my daughter," said the monk, with
    a sudden earnestness on his shining face, "that brought me
    forth even now through the storm to your cottage."</p>

    <p>"Heaven reward you!" cried the widow, fervently.</p>

    <p>"Heaven does reward the charitable!" replied the monk. "To
    no truth do the Scriptures bear such constant and unbroken
    witness; even as it is written: 'He that hath pity upon the
    poor lendeth unto the Lord; and look, what he layeth out it
    shall be paid him again.'"</p>

    <p>"What a blessed thing it must be to be able to do good!"
    sighed the widow, piously wishing in her heart that the holy
    man would not delay to earn his recompense.</p>

    <p>"My daughter," said the monk, "that blessing is not withheld
    from you. It is to ask your help for those in greater need than
    yourself that I am come to-night." And forthwith the good
    brother began to tell how two strangers had sought shelter at
    the monastery. Their house had been struck by lightning, and
    burnt with all it contained; and they themselves, aged, poor,
    and friendless, were exposed to the fury of the storm. "Our
    house is a poor one," continued the monk. "The strangers'
    lodging room was already full, and we are quite without the
    means of making these poor souls comfortable. You at least have
    a sound roof over your head, and if you can spare one or two
    things for the night, they shall be restored to you to-morrow,
    when some of our guests depart."</p>

    <p>The widow could hardly conceal her vexation and
    disappointment. "Now, dear heart, holy father!" cried she, "is
    there not a rich body in the place, that you come for charity
    to a poor old widow like me, that am in a case rather to borrow
    myself than to lend to others?"</p>

    <p>"Can you spare us a blanket?" said the monk. "These poor
    strangers have been out in the storm, remember."</p>

    <p>The widow started. "What meddling busybody told him that the
    Baroness gave me a new blanket at Michaelmas?" thought she; but
    at last, very unwillingly, she went to an inner room to fetch a
    blanket from her bed.</p>

    <p>"They shan't have the new one, that's flat," muttered the
    widow; and she drew out the old one and began to fold it up.
    But though she had made much of its thinness and insufficiency
    to the Baroness, she was so powerfully affected at parting with
    it, that all its good qualities came strongly to her mind.</p>

    <p>"It's a very suitable size," she said to herself, "and easy
    for my poor old arms to shake or fold. With careful usage, it
    would last for years yet; but who knows how two wandering
    bodies that have been tramping miles through the storm may kick
    about in their sleep? And who knows if they're decent folk at
    all? likely enough they're two hedge birds, who have imposed a
    pitiful tale on the good fathers, and never slept under
    anything finer than a shock of straw in their lives."</p>

    <p>The more the good woman thought of this, the more sure she
    felt that such was the case, and the less willing she became to
    lend her blanket to "a couple of good-for-nothing tramps." A
    sudden idea decided her. "Ten to one they bring fever with
    them!" she cried; "and dear knows I saw enough good bedding
    burnt after the black fever, three years ago! It would be a sin
    and a shame to burn a good blanket like this." And repeating "a
    sin and a shame" with great force, the widow restored the
    blanket to its place.</p>

    <p>"The coverlet's not worth much," she thought; "but my
    goodman bought it the year after we were married, and if
    anything happened to it I should never forgive myself. The old
    shawl is good enough for tramps." Saying which she took a
    ragged old shawl from a peg, and began to fold it up. But even
    as she brushed and folded, she begrudged the faded rag.</p>

    <p>"It saves my better one on a bad day," she sighed; "but I
    suppose the father must have something."</p>

    <p>And accordingly she took it to the monk, saying, "It's not
    so good as it has been, but there's warmth in it yet, and it
    cost a pretty penny when new."</p>

    <p>"And is this all that you can spare to the poor houseless
    strangers?" asked the monk.</p>

    <p>"Aye, indeed, good father," said she, "and that will cost me
    many a twinge of rheumatics. Folk at my age can't lie cold at
    night for nothing."</p>

    <p>"These poor strangers," said the monk, "are as aged as
    yourself, and have lost everything."</p>

    <p>But as all he said had no effect in moving the widow's
    compassion, he departed, and knocked at the door of her
    neighbour. Here he told the same tale, which met with a very
    different hearing. This widow was one of those liberal souls
    whose possessions always make them feel uneasy unless they are
    being accepted, or used, or borrowed by some one else. She
    blessed herself that, thanks to the Baroness, she had a new
    blanket fit to lend to the king himself, and only desired to
    know with what else she could serve the poor strangers and
    requite the charities of the brotherhood.</p>

    <p>The monk confessed that all the slender stock of household
    goods in the monastery was in use, and one after another he
    accepted the loan of almost everything the widow had. As she
    gave the things he put them out through the door, saying that
    he had a messenger outside; and having promised that all should
    be duly restored on the morrow, he departed, leaving the widow
    with little else than an old chair in which she was to pass the
    night.</p>

    <p>When the monk had gone, the storm raged with greater fury
    than before, and at last one terrible flash of lightning struck
    the widows' house, and though it did not hurt the old women, it
    set fire to the roof, and both cottages were soon ablaze. Now
    as the terrified old creatures hobbled out into the storm, they
    met the monk, who, crying, "Come to the monastery!" seized an
    arm of each, and hurried them up the hill. To such good purpose
    did he help them, that they seemed to fly, and arrived at the
    convent gate they hardly knew how.</p>

    <p>Under a shed by the wall were the goods and chattels of the
    liberal widow.</p>

    <p>"Take back thine own, daughter," said the monk; "thy charity
    hath brought its own reward."</p>

    <p>"But the strangers, good father?" said the perplexed
    widow.</p>

    <p>"Ye are the strangers," answered the monk; "and what thy
    pity thought meet to be spared for the unfortunate, Heaven in
    thy misfortune hath spared to thee."</p>

    <p>Then turning to the other widow, he drew the old shawl from
    beneath his frock, and gave it to her, saying, "I give you joy,
    dame, that this hath escaped the flames. It is not so good as
    it has been; but there is warmth in it yet, and it cost a
    pretty penny when new."</p>

    <p>Full of confusion, the illiberal widow took back her shawl,
    murmuring, "Lack-a-day! If I had but known it was ourselves the
    good father meant!"</p>

    <p>The monk gave a shrewd smile.</p>

    <p>"Aye, aye, it would have been different, I doubt not," said
    he; "but accept the lesson, my daughter, and when next thou art
    called upon to help the unfortunate, think that it is thine own
    needs that would be served; and it may be thou shalt judge
    better as to what thou canst spare."</p>

    <p>As he spoke, a flash of lightning lit up the ground where
    the monk stood, making a vast aureole about him in the darkness
    of the night. In the bright light, his countenance appeared
    stern and awful in its beauty, and when the flash was passed,
    the monk had vanished also.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, when the widows sought shelter in the
    monastery, they found that the brotherhood knew nothing of
    their strange visitor.</p>

    <h2><a name="KIND_WILLIAM_AND_THE_WATER_SPRITE"
       id="KIND_WILLIAM_AND_THE_WATER_SPRITE"></a>KIND WILLIAM AND
       THE WATER SPRITE.</h2>

    <p>There once lived a poor weaver, whose wife died a few years
    after their marriage. He was now alone in the world except for
    their child, who was a very quick and industrious little lad,
    and, moreover, of such an obliging disposition that he gained
    the nickname of Kind William.</p>

    <p>On his seventh birthday his father gave him a little net
    with a long handle, and with this Kind William betook himself
    to a shallow part of the river to fish. After wandering on for
    some time, he found a quiet pool dammed in by stones, and here
    he dipped for the minnows that darted about in the clear brown
    water. At the first and second casts he caught nothing, but
    with the third he landed no less than twenty-one little fishes,
    and such minnows he had never seen, for as they leaped and
    struggled in the net they shone with alternate tints of green
    and gold.</p>

    <p>He was gazing at them with wonder and delight, when a voice
    behind him cried, in piteous tones&mdash;</p>

    <p>"Oh, my little sisters! Oh, my little sisters!"</p>

    <p>Kind William turned round, and saw, sitting on a rock that
    stood out of the stream, a young girl weeping bitterly. She had
    a very pretty face, and abundant yellow hair of marvellous
    length, and of such uncommon brightness that even in the shade
    it shone like gold. She was dressed in grass green, and from
    her knees downwards she was hidden by the clumps of fern and
    rushes that grew by the stream.</p>

    <p>"What ails you, my little lass?" said Kind William.</p>

    <p>But the maid only wept more bitterly, and wringing her
    hands, repeated, "Oh, my little sisters! Oh, my little
    sisters!" presently adding in the same tone, "The little
    fishes! Oh, the little fishes!"</p>

    <p>"Dry your eyes, and I will give you half of them," said the
    good-natured child; "and if you have no net you shall fish with
    me this afternoon."</p>

    <p>But at this proposal the maid's sobs redoubled, and she
    prayed and begged with frantic eagerness that he would throw
    the fish back into the river. For some time Kind William would
    not consent to throw away his prize, but at last he yielded to
    her excessive grief, and emptied the net into the pool, where
    the glittering fishes were soon lost to sight under the sand
    and pebbles.</p>

    <p>The girl now laughed and clapped her hands.</p>

    <p>"This good deed you shall never rue, Kind William," said
    she, "and even now it shall repay you threefold. How many fish
    did you catch?"</p>

    <p>"Twenty-one," said Kind William, not without regret in his
    tone.</p>

    <p>The maid at once began to pull hairs out of her head, and
    did not stop till she had counted sixty-three, and laid them
    together in her fingers. She then began to wind the lock up
    into a curl, and it took far longer to wind than the
    sixty-three hairs had taken to pull. How long her hair really
    was Kind William never could tell, for after it reached her
    knees he lost sight of it among the fern; but he began to
    suspect that she was no true village maid, but a water sprite,
    and he heartily wished himself safe at home.</p>

    <p>"Now," said she, when the lock was wound, "will you promise
    me three things?"</p>

    <p>"If I can do so without sin," said Kind William.</p>

    <p>"First," she continued, holding out the lock of hair, "will
    you keep this carefully, and never give it away? It will be for
    your own good."</p>

    <p>"One never gives away gifts," said Kind William, "I promise
    that."</p>

    <p>"The second thing is to spare what you have spared. Fish up
    the river and down the river at your will, but swear never to
    cast net in this pool again."</p>

    <p>"One should not do kindness by halves," said Kind William.
    "I promise that also."</p>

    <p>"Thirdly, you must never tell what you have now seen and
    heard till thrice seven years have passed. And now come hither,
    my child, and give me your little finger, that I may see if you
    can keep a secret."</p>

    <p>But by this time Kind William's hairs were standing on end,
    and he gave the last promise more from fear than from any other
    motive, and seized his net to go.</p>

    <p>"No hurry, no hurry," said the maiden (and the words sounded
    like the rippling of a brook over pebbles). Then bending
    towards him, with a strange smile, she added, "You are afraid
    that I shall pinch too hard, my pretty boy. Well, give me a
    farewell kiss before you go."</p>

    <p>"I kiss none but the miller's lass," said Kind William,
    sturdily; for she was his little sweetheart. Besides, he was
    afraid that the water witch would enchant him and draw him
    down. At his answer she laughed till the echoes rang, but Kind
    William shuddered to hear that the echoes seemed to come from
    the river instead of from the hills; and they rang in his ears
    like a distant torrent leaping over rocks.</p>

    <p>"Then listen to my song," said the water sprite. With which
    she drew some of her golden hairs over her arm, and tuning them
    as if they had been the strings of a harp, she began to
    sing:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Warp of woollen and woof of gold:
            <br></span> <span>When seven and seven and seven are
            told."
            <br></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But when Kind William heard that the river was running with
    the cadence of the tune, he could bear it no longer, and took
    to his heels. When he had run a few yards he heard a splash, as
    if a salmon had jumped, and on looking back he found that the
    yellow-haired maiden was gone.</p>

    <p>Kind William was trustworthy as well as obliging, and he
    kept his word. He said nothing of his adventure. He put the
    yellow lock into an old china teapot that had stood untouched
    on the mantelpiece for years. And fishing up the river and down
    the river he never again cast net into the haunted pool. And in
    course of time the whole affair passed from his mind.</p>

    <p>Fourteen years went by, and Kind William was Kind William
    still. He was as obliging as ever, and still loved the miller's
    daughter, who, for her part, had not forgotten her old
    playmate. But the miller's memory was not so good, for the
    fourteen years had been prosperous ones with him, and he was
    rich, whereas they had only brought bad trade and poverty to
    the weaver and his son. So the lovers were not allowed even to
    speak to each other.</p>

    <p>One evening Kind William wandered by the river-side
    lamenting his hard fate. It was his twenty-first birthday, and
    he might not even receive the good wishes of the day from his
    old playmate. It was just growing dusk, a time when prudent
    bodies hurry home from the neighbourhood of fairy rings,
    sprite-haunted streams, and the like, and Kind William was
    beginning to quicken his pace, when a voice from behind him
    sang:</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Warp of woollen and woof of gold:
            <br></span> <span>When seven and seven and seven are
            told."
            <br></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>Kind William felt sure that he had heard this before, though
    he could not recall when or where; but suspecting that it was
    no mortal voice that sang, he hurried home without looking
    behind him. Before he reached the house he remembered all, and
    also that on this very day his promise of secrecy expired.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the old weaver had been sadly preparing the loom
    to weave a small stock of yarn, which he had received in
    payment for some work. He had set up the warp, and was about to
    fill the shuttle, when his son came in and told the story, and
    repeated the water sprite's song.</p>

    <p>"Where is the lock of hair, my son?" asked the old man.</p>

    <p>"In the teapot still, if you have not touched it," said Kind
    William; "but the dust of fourteen years must have destroyed
    all gloss and colour."</p>

    <p>On searching the teapot, however, the lock of hair was found
    to be as bright as ever, and it lay in the weaver's hand like a
    coil of gold.</p>

    <p>"It is the song that puzzles me," said Kind William. "Seven,
    and seven, and seven make twenty-one. Now that is just my
    age."</p>

    <p>"There is your warp of woollen, if that is anything," added
    the weaver, gazing at the loom with a melancholy air.</p>

    <p>"And this is golden enough," laughed Kind William, pointing
    to the curl. "Come, father, let us see how far one hair will go
    on the shuttle." And suiting the action to the word, he began
    to wind. He wound the shuttle full, and then sat down to the
    loom and began to throw.</p>

    <p>The result was a fabric of such beauty that the Weavers
    shouted with amazement, and one single hair served for the woof
    of the whole piece.</p>

    <p>Before long there was not a town dame or a fine country lady
    but must needs have a dress of the new stuff, and before the
    sixty-three hairs were used up, the fortunes of the weaver and
    his son were made.</p>

    <p>About this time the miller's memory became clearer, and he
    was often heard to speak of an old boy-and-girl love between
    his dear daughter and the wealthy manufacturer of the golden
    cloth. Within a year and a day Kind William married his
    sweetheart, and as money sticks to money, in the end he added
    the old miller's riches to his own.</p>

    <p>Moreover there is every reason to believe that he and his
    wife lived happily to the end of their days.</p>

    <p>And what became of the water sprite?</p>

    <p>That you must ask somebody else, for I do not know.</p>

    <p>There was not a nicer boy in all Ireland than Pat, and
    clever at his trade too, if only he'd had one.</p>

    <p>But from his cradle he learned nothing (small blame to him
    with no one to teach him!), so when he came to years of
    discretion, he earned his living by running messages for his

    except when he was in the town, and obliged to look genteel for
    the credit of the place he came from.</p>

    <p>Well, all was going on as peaceable as could be, till one
    market-day, when business (or it may have been pleasure)
    detained him till the heel of the evening, and by nightfall,
    when he began to make the road short in good earnest, he was so
    flustered, rehearsing his messages to make sure he'd forgotten
    nothing, that he never bethought him to leave off his brogues,
    but tramped on just as if shoe-leather were made to be knocked
    to bits on the king's highway.</p>

    <p>And this was what he was after saying:</p>

    <p>"A dozen hanks of grey yarn for Mistress Murphy."</p>

    <p>"Three gross of bright buttons for the tailor."</p>

    <p>"Half an ounce of throat drops for Father Andrew, and an
    ounce of snuff for his housekeeper," and so on.</p>

    <p>For these were what he went to the town to fetch, and he was
    afraid lest one of the lot might have slipped his memory.</p>

    <p>Now everybody knows there are two ways home from the town;
    and that's not meaning the right way and the wrong way, which
    my grandmother (rest her soul!) said there was to every place
    but one that it's not genteel to name. (There could only be a
    wrong way <i>there</i>, she said.) The two ways home from the
    town were the highway, and the way by Murdoch's Rath.</p>

    <p>Murdoch's Rath was a pleasant enough spot in the daytime,
    but not many persons cared to go by it when the sun was down.
    And in all the years Pat was going backwards and forwards, he
    never once came home except by the high-road till this unlucky
    evening, when, just at the place where the two roads part, he
    got, as one may say, into a sort of confusion.</p>

    <p>"Halt!" says he to himself (for his own uncle had been a
    soldier, and Pat knew the word of command). "The left-hand turn
    is the right one," says he, and he was going down the high-road
    as straight as he could go, when suddenly he bethought himself.
    "And what am I doing?" he says. "This was my left hand going to
    town, and how in the name of fortune could it be my left going
    back, considering that I've turned round? It's well that I
    looked into it in time." And with that he went off as fast down
    the other road as he started down this.</p>

    <p>But how far he walked he never could tell, before all of a
    sudden the moon shone out as bright as day, and Pat found
    himself in Murdoch's Rath.</p>

    <p>And this was the smallest part of the wonder; for the Rath
    was full of fairies.</p>

    <p>When Pat got in they were dancing round and round till his
    feet tingled to look at them, being a good dancer himself. And
    as he sat on the side of the Rath, and snapped his fingers to
    mark the time, the dancing stopped, and a little man comes up,
    in a black hat and a green coat, with white stockings, and red
    shoes on his feet.</p>

    <p>"Won't you take a turn with us, Pat?" says he, bowing till
    he nearly touched the ground. And, indeed, he had not far to
    go, for he was barely two feet high.</p>

    <p>"Don't say it twice, sir," says Pat. "It's myself will be
    proud to foot the floor wid ye;" and before you could look
    round, there was Pat in the circle dancing away for bare
    life.</p>

    <p>At first his feet felt like feathers for lightness, and it
    seemed as if he could have gone on for ever. But at last he
    grew tired, and would have liked to stop, but the fairies would
    not, and so they danced on and on. Pat tried to think of
    something <i>good</i> to say, that he might free himself from
    the spell, but all he could think of was:</p>

    <p>"A dozen hanks of grey yarn for Missis Murphy."</p>

    <p>"Three gross of bright buttons for the tailor."</p>

    <p>"Half an ounce of throat drops for Father Andrew, and an
    ounce of snuff for his housekeeper," and so on.</p>

    <p>And it seemed to Pat that the moon was on the one side of
    the Rath when they began to dance, and on the other side when
    they left off; but he could not be sure after all that going
    round. One thing was plain enough. He danced every bit of
    leather off the soles of his feet, and they were blistered so
    that he could hardly stand; but all the little folk did was to
    stand and hold their sides with laughing at him.</p>

    <p>At last the one who spoke before stepped up to him,
    and&mdash;"Don't break your heart about it, Pat," says he;
    "I'll lend you my own shoes till the morning, for you seem to
    be a good-natured sort of a boy."</p>

    <p>Well, Pat looked at the fairy man's shoes, that were the
    size of a baby's, and he looked at his own feet; but not
    wishing to be uncivil, "Thank ye kindly, sir," says he. "And if
    your honour 'll be good enough to put them on for me, maybe you
    won't spoil the shape." For he thought to himself, "Small blame
    to me if the little gentleman can't get them to fit."</p>

    <p>With that he sat down on the side of the Rath, and the fairy
    man put on the shoes for him, and no sooner did they touch
    Pat's feet, than they became altogether a convenient size, and
    fitted him like wax. And, more than that, when he stood up, he
    didn't feel his blisters at all.</p>

    <p>"Bring 'em back to the Rath at sunrise, Pat, my boy," says
    the little man.</p>

    <p>And as Pat was climbing over the ditch, "Look round, Pat,"
    says he. And when Pat looked round, there were jewels and
    pearls lying at the roots of the furze-bushes on the ditch, as
    thick as peas.</p>

    <p>"Will you help yourself, or take what's given ye, Pat?" says
    the fairy man.</p>

    <p>"Did I ever learn manners?" says Pat. "Would you have me
    help myself before company? I'll take what your honour pleases
    to give me, and be thankful."</p>

    <p>The fairy man picked a lot of yellow furze-blossoms from the
    bushes, and filled Pat's pockets.</p>

    <p>"Keep 'em for love, Pat, me darlin'," says he.</p>

    <p>Pat would have liked some of the jewels, but he put the
    furze-blossoms by for love.</p>

    <p>"Good-evening to your honour," says he.</p>

    <p>"And where are you going, Pat, dear?" says the fairy
    man.</p>

    <p>"I'm going home," says Pat. And if the fairy man didn't know
    where that was, small blame to him.</p>

    <p>"Just let me dust them shoes for ye, Pat," says the fairy
    man. And as Pat lifted up each foot he breathed on it, and
    dusted it with the tail of his green coat.</p>

    <p>"Home!" says he, and when he let go, Pat was at his own
    doorstep before he could look round, and his parcels safe and
    sound with him.</p>

    <p>Next morning he was up with the sun, and carried the fairy
    man's shoes back to the Rath. As he came up, the little man
    looked over the ditch.</p>

    <p>"The top of the morning to, your honour," says Pat; "here's
    your shoes."</p>

    <p>"You're an honest boy, Pat," says the little gentleman.
    "It's inconvenienced I am without them, for. I have but the one
    pair. Have you looked at the yellow flowers this morning?" he
    says.</p>

    <p>"I have not, sir," says Pat; "I'd be loth to deceive you. I
    came off as soon as I was up."</p>

    <p>"Be sure to look when you get back, Pat," says the fairy
    man, "and good luck to ye."</p>

    <p>With which he disappeared, and Pat went home. He looked for
    the furze-blossoms, as the fairy man told him, and there's not
    a word of truth in this tale if they weren't all pure gold
    pieces.</p>

    <p>Well, now Pat was so rich, he went to the shoemaker to order
    another pair of brogues, and being a kindly, gossiping boy, the
    shoemaker soon learned the whole story of the fairy man and the
    Rath. And this so stirred up the shoemaker's greed that he
    resolved to go the very next night himself, to see if he could
    not dance with the fairies, and have like luck.</p>

    <p>He found his way to the Rath all correct, and sure enough
    the fairies were dancing, and they asked him to join. He danced
    the soles off his brogues, as Pat did, and the fairy man lent
    him his shoes, and sent him home in a twinkling.</p>

    <p>As he was going over the ditch, he looked round, and saw the
    roots of the furze-bushes glowing with precious stones as if
    they had been glow-worms.</p>

    <p>"Will you help yourself, or take what's given ye?" said the
    fairy man.</p>

    <p>"I'll help myself, if you please," said the cobbler, for he
    thought&mdash;"If I can't get more than Pat brought home, my
    fingers must all be thumbs."</p>

    <p>So he drove his hand into the bushes, and if he didn't get
    plenty, it wasn't for want of grasping.</p>

    <p>When he got up in the morning, he went straight to the
    jewels. But not a stone of the lot was more precious than
    roadside pebbles. "I ought not to look till I come from the
    Rath," said he. "It's best to do like Pat all through."</p>

    <p>But he made up his mind not to return the fairy man's
    shoes.</p>

    <p>"Who knows the virtue that's in them?" he said. So he made a
    small pair of red leather shoes, as like them as could be, and
    he blacked the others upon his feet, that the fairies might not
    know them, and at sunrise he went to the Rath.</p>

    <p>The fairy man was looking over the ditch as before.</p>

    <p>"Good-morning to you," said he.</p>

    <p>"The top of the morning to you, sir," said the cobbler;
    "here's your shoes." And he handed him the pair that he had
    made, with a face as grave as a judge.</p>

    <p>The fairy man looked at them, but he said nothing, though he
    did not put them on.</p>

    <p>"Have you looked at the things you got last night?" says
    he.</p>

    <p>"I'll not deceive you, sir," says the cobbler. "I came off
    as soon as I was up. Sorra peep I took at them."</p>

    <p>"Be sure to look when you get back," says the fairy man. And
    just as the cobbler was getting over the ditch to go home, he
    says:</p>

    <p>"If my eyes don't deceive me," says he, "there's the least
    taste in life of dirt on your left shoe. Let me dust it with
    the tail of my coat."</p>

    <p>"That means home in a twinkling," thought the cobbler, and
    he held up his foot.</p>

    <p>The fairy man dusted it, and muttered something the cobbler
    did not hear. Then, "Sure," says he, "it's the dirty pastures
    that you've come through, for the other shoe's as bad."</p>

    <p>So the cobbler held up his right foot, and the fairy man
    rubbed that with the tail of his green coat.</p>

    <p>When all was done the cobbler's feet seemed to tingle, and
    then to itch, and then to smart, and then to burn. And at last
    he began to dance, and he danced all round the Rath (the fairy
    man laughing and holding his sides), and then round and round
    again. And he danced till he cried out with weariness, and
    tried to shake the shoes off. But they stuck fast, and the
    fairies drove him over, the ditch, and through the prickly
    furze-bushes, and he danced away. Where he danced to, I cannot
    tell you. Whether he ever got rid of the fairy shoes, I do not
    know. The jewels never were more than wayside pebbles, and they
    were swept out when his cabin was cleaned, which was not too
    soon, you may be sure.</p>

    <p>All this happened long ago; but there are those who say that
    the covetous cobbler dances still, between sunset and sunrise,
    round Murdoch's Rath.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_LITTLE_DARNER"
       id="THE_LITTLE_DARNER"></a>THE LITTLE DARNER.</h2>

    <p>In days gone by there lived a poor widow who had brought up
    her only child so well that the little lass was more helpful
    and handy than many a grown-up person.</p>

    <p>When other women's children were tearing and dirtying their
    clothes, clamouring at their mothers' skirts for this and that,
    losing and breaking and spoiling things, and getting into
    mischief of all kinds, the widow's little girl, with her tiny
    thimble on her finger, could patch quite neatly. She was to be
    trusted to put anything in its proper place, and when meals
    were over she would stand on a little stool at the table
    washing up the dishes. Moreover, she could darn stockings so
    well that the darn looked like a part of the stocking. The
    slatternly mothers, who spoiled and scolded their children by
    turns, and had never taught them to be tidy and obedient, used
    often to quote the widow's little girl to their troublesome
    brats, and say, "Why don't you help your mother as the widow's
    daughter helps her?"</p>

    <p>Thus it came about that the helpless, useless, untidy little
    girls hated the very name of the widow's daughter, because they
    were always being told of her usefulness and neatness.</p>

    <p>Now the widow's child often earned a few pence by herding
    sheep or pigs for the farmers, or by darning stockings for
    their wives, and as she could be trusted, people were very glad
    to employ her. One day she was keeping watch over five little
    pigs in a field, and, not to waste time, was darning a pair of
    stockings as well, when some of the little girls who had a
    spite against her resolved to play her a trick.</p>

    <p>Near the field where the little maid and the pigs were there
    was a wood, into which all children were strictly forbidden to
    go. For in the depths of the wood there lived a terrible Ogre
    and Ogress, who kidnapped all children who strayed near their
    dwelling. Every morning the Ogre threw a big black bag over his
    shoulder, and stalked through the forest, making the ground
    shake as he walked. If he found any truant children he popped
    them into his bag, and when he got home his wife cooked them
    for supper.</p>

    <p>The trick played upon the widow's daughter was this. Five
    little girls came up to the field where she was herding the
    five little pigs, and each chasing a pig, they drove them into
    the Ogre's wood. In vain the little maid called to her flock;
    the pigs ran in a frightened troop into the wood, and she ran
    after them. When the five little girls saw that she had got
    them together again, they ran in to chase them away once more,
    and so they were all in the wood together, when the ground
    shook under them, upsetting the six little girls and the five
    little pigs; and as they rolled over the Ogre picked them up,
    and put them one after another into his bag.</p>

    <p>When they were jolting about with the pigs in the poke as
    the Ogre strode homewards, the five spiteful children were as
    sorry as you please; and as the pigs were always fighting and
    struggling to get to the top, they did not escape without some
    scratches. And their screams, and the squealing of the little
    pigs made such a noise that the Ogre's wife heard it a mile and
    a half away in the depths of the wood; and she lighted a fire
    under the copper, and filled it with water, ready to cook
    whatever her husband brought home.</p>

    <p>As for the widow's little daughter she pulled her
    needle-book from her pocket, and every now and then she pushed
    a needle through the sack, that it might fall on the ground,
    and serve as a guide if she should ever have the chance of
    finding her way home again.</p>

    <p>When the Ogre arrived, he emptied the sack, and sent the six
    little girls and the five little pigs all sprawling on to the
    floor, saying:</p>

    <p>"These will last us some time. Cook the fattest, and put the
    rest into the cellar. And whilst you get dinner ready, I will
    take another stroll with the bag. Luck seldom comes
    singly."</p>

    <p>When he had gone, the Ogress looked over the children, and
    picked out the widow's daughter, saying:</p>

    <p>"You look the most good-humoured. And the best-tempered
    always make the best eating."</p>

    <p>So she set her down on a stool by the fire till the water
    should boil, and locked the others up in the cellar.</p>

    <p>"Tears won't put the fire out," thought the little maid. So
    instead of crying she pulled out the old stocking, and went on
    with her darning. When the Ogress came back from the cellar she
    went up to her and looked at her work.</p>

    <p>"How you darn!" she cried. "Now that's a sort of thing I
    hate. And the Ogre does wear such big holes in his stockings,
    and his feet are so large, that, though my hand is not a small
    one, I cannot fill out the heel with my fist, and then who's to
    darn it neatly I should like to know?"</p>

    <p>"If I had a basin big enough to fill out the heel, I think I
    could do it," said the little maid.</p>

    <p>The Ogress scratched her big ear thoughtfully for a minute,
    and then she said:</p>

    <p>"To lose a chance is to cheat oneself. Why shouldn't this
    one darn while the others boil? Yes, I think you shall try. Six
    days ought to serve for mending all the stockings, though the
    Ogre hasn't a whole pair left, and angry enough he'll be. And
    when household matters are not to his mind he puts that big
    sack over my head, and ties it round my neck. And if you had
    ever done housework with your head in a poke, you'd know what
    it is! So you shall darn the stockings, and if you do them
    well, I'll cook one of the others first instead of you."</p>

    <p>Saying which, the Ogress fetched one of the Ogre's
    stockings, and the widow's child put a big basin into the heel
    to stretch it, and began to darn. The Ogress watched her till
    she had put all the threads one way, and when she began to run
    the cross threads, interlacing them with the utmost exactness,
    the old creature was delighted, and went to fetch another child
    to be cooked instead of the widow's.</p>

    <p>When the other little girl came up, she cried and screamed
    so that the room rang with her lamentations, and the widow's
    child laid down her needle and ceased working.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you go on darning?" asked the Ogress.</p>

    <p>"Alas! dear mother," said she, "the little sister's cries
    make my heart beat so that I cannot darn evenly."</p>

    <p>"Then she must go back to the cellar for a bit," said the
    Ogress. "And meanwhile I'll sharpen the knife."</p>

    <p>So after she had taken back the crying child, and had
    watched the little girl, who now darned away as skilfully as
    ever, the Ogress took down a huge knife from the wall, and
    began to sharpen it on a grindstone in a corner of the kitchen.
    As she sharpened the knife, she glanced from time to time at
    the little maid, and soon perceived that she had once more
    ceased working.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you go on darning?" asked the Ogress.</p>

    <p>"Alas! dear mother," said the child, "when I hear you
    sharpening that terrible knife my hands tremble so that I
    cannot thread my needle."</p>

    <p>"Well, it will do now," growled the Ogress, feeling the edge
    of the blade with her horny finger; and, having seen the
    darning-needle once more at work, she went to fetch up one of
    the children. As she went, she hummed what cookmaids
    sing&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <span>"Dilly, dilly duckling, come and be killed!"
            <br></span>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>But it sounded like the wheezing and groaning of a heavy old
    door upon its rusty hinges.</p>

    <p>When she came in, with the child in one hand, and the huge
    knife in the other, she went up to the little darner to look at
    her work. The heel of the Ogre's stocking was exquisitely
    mended, all but seven threads; but the little maid sat idle
    with her hands before her.</p>

    <p>"Why don't you go on darning?" asked the Ogress.</p>

    <p>"Alas! dear mother," was the reply, "when I think of my
    little playmate about to die, the tears blind my eyes, so that
    I cannot see what stitches I take. Wherefore I beg of you, dear
    mother, to cook one of the little pigs instead, that I may be
    able to go on with my work, and that a pair of stockings may be
    ready to-morrow morning when the Ogre will ask for them; so my
    playmate's life will be spared, and your head will not be put
    into a poke."</p>

    <p>At first the Ogress would not hear of such a thing, but at
    last she consented, and made a stew of one of the little pigs
    instead of cooking the little girl.</p>

    <p>"But supposing the Ogre goes to count the children," said
    she; "he will find one too many."</p>

    <p>"Then let her go, dear mother," said the widow's daughter;
    "she will find her way home, and you will never be blamed."</p>

    <p>"But she must stir the stew with her forefinger first," said
    the Ogress, "that it may have a human flavour."</p>

    <p>So the little girl had to stir the hot stew with her finger,
    which scalded it badly; and then she was set at liberty, and
    ran home as hard as she could; and as the little maid's needles
    sparkled here and there on the path, she had no difficulty in
    finding her way.</p>

    <p>The Ogre was quite contented with his dinner, and the Ogress
    got great praise for the way in which she had darned his
    stockings. Thus it went on for four days more. As the widow's
    little girl wouldn't work if her companions were killed, the
    Ogress cooked the pigs one after another, and the children were
    all sent away with burnt forefingers.</p>

    <p>When the fifth had been dismissed, and all the pigs were
    eaten, the Ogress said:</p>

    <p>"To-morrow you will have to be stewed, and now I wish I had
    kept one of the others that I might have saved you altogether
    to work for me. However, there is one comfort, the stockings
    are finished."</p>

    <p>But meanwhile the other children had got safely home, and
    had told their tale. And all the men of the place set off at
    once to attack the Ogre, and release the widow's child. Guided
    by the needles, they arrived just as the Ogress was sharpening
    the big knife for the last time.</p>

    <p>So they killed the Ogre and his wife, and took the
    industrious little maid back to her mother.</p>

    <p>The other little girls were now very repentant; and when
    their fingers were well, they all learned to darn stockings at
    once.</p>

    <p>And as there was now no danger about going into the wood, it
    was no longer forbidden. And this being the case, the children
    were much less anxious to play there than formerly.</p>

    <p>Generations ago, there once lived a farmer's son, who had no
    great harm in him, and no great good either. He always meant
    well, but he had a poor spirit, and was too fond of idle
    company.</p>

    <p>One day his father sent him to market with some sheep for
    sale, and when business was over for the day, the rest of the
    country-folk made ready to go home, and more than one of them
    offered the lad a lift in his cart.</p>

    <p>"Thank you kindly, all the same," said he, "but I am going
    back across the downs with Limping Tim."</p>

    <p>Then out spoke a steady old farmer and bade the lad go home
    with the rest, and by the main road. For Limping Tim was an
    idle, graceless kind of fellow, who fiddled for his livelihood,
    but what else he did to earn the money he squandered, no one
    knew. And as to the sheep path over the downs, it stands to
    reason that the highway is better travelling after sunset, for
    the other is no such very short cut; and has a big fairy ring
    so near it, that a butter-woman might brush it with the edge of
    her market cloak, as she turned the brow of the hill.</p>

    <p>But the farmer's son would go his own way, and that was with
    Limping Tim, and across the downs.</p>

    <p>So they started, and the fiddler had his fiddle in his hand,
    and a bundle of marketings under his arm, and he sang snatches
    of strange songs, the like of which the lad had never heard
    before. And the moon drew out their shadows over the short
    grass till they were as long as the great stones of
    Stonehenge.</p>

    <p>At last they turned the hill, and the fairy ring looked dark
    under the moon, and the farmer's son blessed himself that they
    were passing it quietly, when Limping Tim suddenly pulled his
    cloak from his back, and handing it to his companion, cried,
    "Hold this for a moment, will you? I'm wanted. They're calling
    for me."</p>

    <p>"I hear nothing," said the farmer's son. But before he had
    got the words out of his mouth, the fiddler had completely
    disappeared. He shouted aloud, but in vain, and had begun to
    think of proceeding on his way, when the fiddler's voice cried,
    "Catch!" and there came, flying at him from the direction of
    the fairy ring, the bundle of marketings which the fiddler had
    been carrying.</p>

    <p>"It's in my way," he then heard the fiddler cry. "Ah, this
    is dancing! Come in, my lad, come in!"</p>

    <p>But the farmer's son was not totally without prudence, and
    he took good care to keep at a safe distance from the fairy
    ring.</p>

    <p>"Come back, Tim! Come back!" he shouted, and, receiving no
    answer, he adjured his friend to break the bonds that withheld
    him, and return to the right way, as wisely as one man can
    counsel another.</p>

    <p>After talking for some time to no purpose, he again heard
    his friend's voice, crying, "Take care of it for me! The money
    dances out of my pocket." And therewith the fiddler's purse was
    hurled to his feet, where it fell with a heavy chinking of gold
    within.</p>

    <p>He picked it up, and renewed his warnings and entreaties,
    but in vain; and, after waiting for a long time, he made the
    best of his way home alone, hoping that the fiddler would
    follow, and come to reclaim his property.</p>

    <p>The fiddler never came. And when at last there was a fuss
    about his disappearance, the farmer's son, who had but a poor
    spirit, began to be afraid to tell the truth of the matter.
    "Who knows but they may accuse me of theft?" said he. So he hid
    the cloak, and the bundle, and the money-bag in the garden.</p>

    <p>But when three months passed, and still the fiddler did not
    return, it was whispered that the farmer's son had been his
    last companion; and the place was searched, and they found the
    cloak, and the bundle, and the money-bag and the lad was taken
    to prison.</p>

    <p>Now, when it was too late, he plucked up a spirit, and told
    the truth; but no one believed him, and it was said that he had
    murdered the fiddler for the sake of his money and goods. And
    he was taken before the judge, found guilty, and sentenced to
    death.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, his old mother was a Wise Woman. And when she
    heard that he was condemned, she said, "Only follow my
    directions, and we may save you yet; for I guess how it
    is."</p>

    <p>So she went to the judge, and begged for her son three
    favours before his death.</p>

    <p>"I will grant them," said the judge, "if you do not ask for
    his life."</p>

    <p>"The first," said the old woman, "is, that he may choose the
    place where the gallows shall be erected; the second, that he
    may fix the hour of his execution; and the third favour is,
    that you will not fail to be present."</p>

    <p>"I grant all three," said the judge. But when he learned
    that the criminal had chosen a certain hill on the downs for
    the place of execution, and an hour before midnight for the
    time, he sent to beg the sheriff to bear him company on this
    important occasion.</p>

    <p>The sheriff placed himself at the judge's disposal, but he
    commanded the attendance of the gaoler as some sort of
    protection; and the gaoler, for his part, implored his
    reverence the chaplain to be of the party, as the hill was not
    in good spiritual repute. So, when the time came, the four
    started together, and the hangman and the farmer's son went
    before them to the foot of the gallows.</p>

    <p>Just as the rope was being prepared, the farmer'a son called
    to the judge, and said, "If your Honour will walk twenty paces
    down the hill, to where you will see a bit of paper, you will
    learn the fate of the fiddler."</p>

    <p>"That is, no doubt, a copy of the poor man's last
    confession," thought the judge.</p>

    <p>"Murder will out, Mr. Sheriff," said he; and in the
    interests of truth and justice he hastened to pick up the
    paper.</p>

    <p>But the farmer's son had dropped it as he came along, by his
    mother's direction, in such a place that the judge could not
    pick it up without putting his foot on the edge of the fairy
    ring. No sooner had he done so than he perceived an innumerable
    company of little people dressed in green cloaks and hoods, who
    were dancing round in a circle as wide as the ring itself.</p>

    <p>They were all about two feet high, and had aged faces, brown
    and withered, like the knots on gnarled trees in hedge bottoms,
    and they squinted horribly; but, in spite of their seeming age,
    they flew round and round like children.</p>

    <p>"Mr. Sheriff! Mr. Sheriff!" cried the judge, "come and see
    the dancing. And hear the music, too, which is so lively that
    it makes the soles of my feet tickle."</p>

    <p>"There is no music, my Lord Judge," said the sheriff,
    running down the hill. "It is the wind whistling over the grass
    that your lordship hears."</p>

    <p>But when the sheriff had put his foot by the judge's foot,
    he saw and heard the same, and he cried out, "Quick, Gaoler,
    and come down! I should like you to be witness to this matter.
    And you may take my arm, Gaoler, for the music makes me feel
    unsteady."</p>

    <p>"There is no music, sir," said the gaoler; "but your worship
    doubtless hears the creaking of the gallows."</p>

    <p>But no sooner had the gaoler's feet touched the fairy ring,
    than he saw and heard like the rest, and he called lustily to
    the chaplain to come and stop the unhallowed measure.</p>

    <p>"It is a delusion of the Evil One," said the parson; "there
    is not a sound in the air but the distant croaking of some
    frogs." But when he too touched the ring, he perceived his
    mistake.</p>

    <p>At this moment the moon shone out, and in the middle of the
    ring they saw Limping Tim the fiddler, playing till great drops
    stood out on his forehead, and dancing as madly as he
    played.</p>

    <p>"Ah, you rascal!" cried the judge. "Is this where you've
    been all the time, and a better man than you as good as hanged
    for you? But you shall come home now."</p>

    <p>Saying which, he ran in, and seized the fiddler by the arm,
    but Limping Tim resisted so stoutly that the sheriff had to go
    to the judge's assistance, and even then the fairies so pinched
    and hindered them that the sheriff was obliged to call upon the
    gaoler to put his arms about his waist, who persuaded the
    chaplain to add his strength to the string. But as ill luck
    would have it, just as they were getting off, one of the
    fairies picked up Limping Tim's fiddle, which had fallen in the
    scuffle, and began to play. And as he began to play, every one
    began to dance&mdash;the fiddler, and the judge, and the
    sheriff, and the gaoler, and even the chaplain.</p>

    <p>"Hangman! hangman!" screamed the judge, as he lifted first
    one leg and then the other to the tune, "come down, and catch
    hold of his reverence the chaplain. The prisoner is pardoned,
    and he can lay hold too."</p>

    <p>The hangman knew the judge's voice, and ran towards it; but
    as they were now quite within the ring he could see nothing,
    either of him or his companions.</p>

    <p>The farmer's son followed, and warning the hangman not to
    touch the ring, he directed him to stretch his hands forwards
    in hopes of catching hold of some one. In a few minutes the
    wind blew the chaplain's cassock against the hangman's fingers,
    and he caught the parson round the waist. The farmer's son then
    seized him in like fashion, and each holding firmly by the
    other, the fiddler, the judge, the sheriff, the gaoler, the
    parson, the hangman, and the farmer's son all got safely out of
    the charmed circle.</p>

    <p>"Oh, you scoundrel!" cried the judge to the fiddler; "I have
    a very good mind to hang you up on the gallows without further
    ado."</p>

    <p>But the fiddler only looked like one possessed, and
    upbraided the farmer's son for not having the patience to wait
    three minutes for him.</p>

    <p>"Three minutes!" cried he; "why, you've been here three
    months and a day."</p>

    <p>This the fiddler would not believe, and as he seemed in
    every way beside himself, they led him home, still upbraiding
    his companion, and crying continually for his fiddle.</p>

    <p>His neighbours watched him closely, but one day he escaped
    from their care and wandered away over the hills to seek his
    fiddle, and came back no more.</p>

    <p>His dead body was found upon the downs, face downwards, with
    the fiddle in his arms. Some said he had really found the
    fiddle where he had left it, and had been lost in a mist, and
    died of exposure. But others held that he had perished
    differently, and laid his death at the door of the fairy
    dancers.</p>

    <p>As to the farmer's son, it is said that thenceforward he
    went home from market by the high-road, and spoke the truth
    straight out, and was more careful of his company.</p>

    <h2><a name="I_WONT"
       id="I_WONT"></a>"I WON'T."</h2>

    <p>"Don't Care"&mdash;so they say&mdash;fell into a goose-pond;
    and "I won't" is apt to come to no better an end. At least, my
    grandmother tells me that was how the Miller had to quit his
    native town, and leave the tip of his nose behind him.</p>

    <p>It all came of his being allowed to say "I won't" when he
    was quite a little boy. His mother thought he looked pretty
    when he was pouting, and that wilfulness gave him an air which
    distinguished him from other people's children. And when she
    found out that his lower lip was becoming so big that it spoilt
    his beauty, and that his wilfulness gained his way twice and
    stood in his way eight times out of ten, it was too late to
    alter him.</p>

    <p>Then she said, "Dearest Abinadab, do be more obliging!"</p>

    <p>And he replied (as she had taught him), "I won't."</p>

    <p>He always took what he could get, and would neither give nor
    give up to other people. This, he thought, was the way to get
    more out of life than one's neighbours.</p>

    <p>Amongst other things, he made a point of taking the middle
    of the footpath.</p>

    <p>"Will you allow me to pass you, sir?&mdash;I am in a hurry,"
    said a voice behind him one day.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said Abinadab; on which a poor washerwoman, with
    her basket, scrambled down into the road, and Abinadab
    chuckled.</p>

    <p>Next day he was walking as before.</p>

    <p>"Will you allow me to pass you, sir?&mdash;I am in a hurry,"
    said a voice behind him.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said Abinadab. On which he was knocked into the
    ditch; and the Baron walked on, and left him to get out of the
    mud on whichever side he liked.</p>

    <p>He quarrelled with his friends till he had none left, and he
    quarrelled with the tradesmen of the town till there was only
    one who would serve him, and this man offended him at last.</p>

    <p>"I'll show you who's master!" said the Miller. "I won't pay
    a penny of your bill&mdash;not a penny."</p>

    <p>"Sir," said the tradesman, "my giving you offence now, is no
    just reason why you should refuse to pay for what you have had
    and been satisfied with. I must beg you to pay me at once."</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller, "and what I say I mean. I won't;
    I tell you, I won't."</p>

    <p>So the tradesman summoned him before the Justice, and the
    Justice condemned him to pay the bill and the costs of the
    suit.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller.</p>

    <p>So they put him in prison, and in prison he would have
    remained if his mother had not paid the money to obtain his
    release. By and by she died, and left him her blessing and some
    very good advice, which (as is sometimes the case with
    bequests) would have been more useful if it had come
    earlier.</p>

    <p>The Miller's mother had taken a great deal of trouble off
    his hands which now fell into them. She took in all the small
    bags of grist which the country-folk brought to be ground, and
    kept account of them, and spoke civilly to the customers, big
    and little. But these small matters irritated the Miller.</p>

    <p>"I may be the slave of all the old women in the
    country-side," said he; "but I won't&mdash;they shall see that
    I won't."</p>

    <p>So he put up a notice to say that he would only receive
    grist at a certain hour on certain days. Now, but a third of
    the old women could read the notice, and they did not attend to
    it. People came as before; but the Miller locked the door of
    the mill and sat in the counting-house and chuckled.</p>

    <p>"My good friend," said his neighbours, "you can't do
    business in this way. If a man lives by trade, he must serve
    his customers. And a Miller must take in grist when it comes to
    the mill."</p>

    <p>"Others may if they please," said the Miller; "but I won't.
    When I make a rule, I stick to it."</p>

    <p>"Take advice, man, or you'll be ruined," said his
    friends.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller.</p>

    <p>In a few weeks all the country-folk turned their donkeys'
    heads towards the windmill on the heath. It was a little
    farther to go, but the Windmiller took custom when it came to
    him, gave honest measure, and added civil words gratis.</p>

    <p>The other Miller was ruined.</p>

    <p>"All you can do now is to leave the mill while you can pay
    the rent, and try another trade," said his friends.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller. "Shall I be turned out of the
    house where I was born, because the country-folk are
    fools?"</p>

    <p>However, he could not pay the rent, and the landlord found
    another tenant.</p>

    <p>"You must quit," said he to the Miller.</p>

    <p>"That I won't," said the Miller, "not for fifty new
    tenants."</p>

    <p>So the landlord sent for the constables, and he was carried
    out, which is not a dignified way of changing one's residence.
    But then it is not easy to be obstinate and dignified at the
    same time.</p>

    <p>His wrath against the landlord knew no bounds.</p>

    <p>"Was there ever such a brute?" he cried. "Would any man of
    spirit hold his home at the whim of a landlord? I'll never rent
    another house as long as I live."</p>

    <p>"But you must live somewhere," said his friends.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller.</p>

    <p>He was no longer a young man, and the new tenant pitied
    him.</p>

    <p>"The poor old fellow is out of his senses," he said. And he
    let him sleep in one of his barns. One of the mill cats found
    out that there was a new warm bed in this barn, and she came
    and lived there too, and kept away the mice.</p>

    <p>One night, however, Mrs. Pussy disturbed the Miller's rest.
    She was in and out of the window constantly, and meowed
    horribly into the bargain.</p>

    <p>"It seems a man can't even sleep in peace," said the Miller.
    "If this happens again, you'll go into the mill-race to sing to
    the fishes."</p>

    <p>The next night the cat was still on the alert, and the
    following morning the Miller tied a stone round her neck, and
    threw her into the water.</p>

    <p>"Oh, spare the poor thing, there's a good soul," said a
    bystander.</p>

    <p>"I won't," said the Miller. "I told her what would
    happen."</p>

    <p>When his back was turned, however, the bystander got Pussy
    out, and took her home with him.</p>

    <p>Now the cat was away, the mice could play; and they played
    hide-and seek over the Miller's nightcap.</p>

    <p>It came to such a pass that there was no rest to be had.</p>

    <p>"I won't go to bed, I declare I won't," said the Miller. So
    he sat up all night in an arm-chair, and threw everything he
    could lay his hands on at the corners where he heard the mice
    scuffling, till the place was topsy-turvy.</p>

    <p>Towards morning he lit a candle and dressed himself. He was
    in a terrible humour; and when he began to shave, his hand
    shook and he cut himself. The draughts made the flame of the
    candle unsteady too, and the shadow of the Miller's nose (which
    was a large one) fell in uncertain shapes upon his cheeks, and
    interfered with the progress of the razor. At first he thought
    he would wait till daylight. Then his temper got the better of
    him.</p>

    <p>"I won't," he said, "I won't; why should I?"</p>

    <p>So he began again. He held on by his nose to steady his
    cheeks, and he gave it such a spiteful pinch that the tears
    came into his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Matters have come to a pretty pass, when a man's own nose
    is to stand in his light," said he.</p>

    <p>By and by a gust of wind came through the window. Up flared
    the candle, and the shadow of the Miller's nose danced half
    over his face, and the razor gashed his chin.</p>

    <p>Transported with fury, he struck at it before he could think
    what he was doing. The razor was very sharp, and the tip of the
    Miller's nose came off as clean as his whiskers.</p>

    <p>When daylight came, and he saw himself in the glass, he
    resolved to leave the place.</p>

    <p>"I won't stay here to be a laughing-stock," said he.</p>

    <p>As he trudged out on to the highway, with his bundle on his
    back, the Baron met him and pitied him. He dismounted from his
    horse, and leading it up to the Miller, he said:</p>

    <p>"Friend, you are elderly to be going far afoot. I will lend
    you my mare to take you to your destination. When you are
    there, knot the reins and throw them on her shoulder, saying,
    'Home!' She will then return to me. But mark one
    thing,&mdash;she is not used to whip or spur. Humour her, and
    she will carry you well and safely."</p>

    <p>The Miller mounted willingly enough, and set forward. At
    first the mare was a little restive. The Miller had no spurs
    on, but, in spite of the Baron's warning, he kicked her with
    his heels. On this, she danced till the Miller's hat and bundle
    flew right and left, and he was very near to following
    them.</p>

    <p>"Ah, you vixen!" he cried. "You think I'll humour you as the
    Baron does. But I won't&mdash;no, you shall see that I won't!"
    And gripping his walking-stick firmly in his hand, he
    belaboured the Baron's mare as if she had been a donkey.</p>

    <p>On which she sent the Miller clean over her head, and
    cantered back to the castle; and wherever it was that he went
    to, he had to walk.</p>

    <p>He never returned to his native village, and everybody was
    glad to be rid of him. One must bear and forbear with his
    neighbours, if he hopes to be regretted when he departs.</p>

    <p>But my grandmother says that long after the mill had fallen
    into ruin, the story was told as a warning to wilful children
    of the Miller who cut off his nose to spite his own face.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_MAGIC_JAR"
       id="THE_MAGIC_JAR"></a>THE MAGIC JAR.</h2>

    <p>There was once a young fellow whom fortune had blessed with
    a good mother, a clever head, and a strong body. But beyond
    this she had not much favoured him; and though able and willing
    to work, he had often little to do, and less to eat. But his
    mother had taught him to be contented with his own lot, and to
    feel for others. Moreover, from her he inherited a great love
    for flowers.</p>

    <p>One day, when his pockets were emptiest, a fair was held in
    the neighbouring town, and he must needs go as well as the
    rest, though he had no money to spend. But he stuck a buttercup
    in his cap, for which he had nothing to pay, and strode along
    as merrily as the most.</p>

    <p>Towards evening some of the merrymakers became riotous; and
    a party of them fell upon an old Jew who was keeping a stall of
    glass and china, and would smash his stock. Now as the Jew
    stood before his booth beseeching them to spare his property,
    up came the strong young man, with the flower still unwithered
    in his cap, and he took the old Jew's part and defended him.
    For from childhood his mother had taught him to feel for
    others.</p>

    <p>So those who would have ill-treated the old Jew now moved
    off, and the young man stayed with him till he had packed up
    his wares.</p>

    <p>Then the Jew turned towards him and said, "My son, he who
    delivers the oppressed, and has respect unto the aged, has need
    of no reward, for the blessing of Him that blesseth is about
    him. Nevertheless, that I may not seem ungrateful, choose, I
    pray thee, one of these china jars; and take it to thee for
    thine own. If thou shalt choose well, it may be of more use to
    thee than presently appears."</p>

    <p>Thereupon the young man examined the jars, which were highly
    ornamented with many figures and devices; but he chose one that
    was comparatively plain; only it had a bunch of flowers painted
    on the front, round which was a pretty device in spots or
    circles of gold.</p>

    <p>Then said the Jew, "My son, why have you chosen this jar,
    when there are others so much finer?"</p>

    <p>The young man said, "Because the flowers please me, and I
    have a love for flowers."</p>

    <p>Then said the Jew, "Happy is he whose tastes are simple!
    Moreover, herein is a rare wisdom, and thou hast gained that
    which is the most valuable of my possessions. This jar has
    properties which I will further explain to thee. It was given
    to me by a wise woman, subject to this condition, that I must
    expose it for sale from sunrise to sunset at the yearly fair.
    When I understood this I took counsel with myself how I should
    preserve it; and I bought other china jars of more apparent
    value, and I marked them all with the same price. For I said
    within myself, 'There is no man who does not desire to get as
    much as he can for his money, therefore, from its contrast with
    these others, my jar is safe.' And it was even so; for truly,
    many have desired to buy the jar because of the delicate beauty
    of the flowers, if I would have sold it for less than others
    which seemed more valuable."</p>

    <p>"Many times it has been almost gone, but when I have shown
    the others at the same price, my customers have reviled me,
    saying, 'Dog of a Jew, dost thou ask as much for this as for
    these others Which are manifestly worth double?' and they have
    either departed, cursing me, and taking nothing; or they have
    bought one of the more richly decorated jars at the same price.
    For verily in most men the spirit of covetousness is stronger
    than the love of beauty, and they rather desire to get much for
    their money, than to obtain that which is suitable and
    convenient."</p>

    <p>"But in thee, O young man! I have beheld a rare wisdom. To
    choose that which is good in thine eyes, and suitable to thy
    needs, rather than that which satisfieth the lust of
    over-reaching; and lo! what I have so long kept from thousands,
    has become thine!"</p>

    <p>Then the young man wished to restore to the Jew the jar he
    valued so highly, and to choose another.</p>

    <p>But the Jew refused, saying, "A gift cannot be recalled.
    Moreover, I will now explain to thee its uses. Within the jar
    lies a toad, whose spit is poison. But it will never spit at
    its master. Every evening thou must feed it with bread and
    milk, when it will fall asleep; and at sunrise in the morning
    it will awake and breathe heavily against the side of the jar,
    which will thus become warm. As it warms the flowers will
    blossom out, and become real, and full of perfume, and thou
    wilt be able to pluck them without diminishing their number.
    Moreover, these twelve round spots of gold will drop off, and
    become twelve gold pieces, which will be thine. And thus it
    will be every day. Only thou must thyself rise with the sun,
    and gather the flowers and the gold with thine own hands.
    Furthermore, when the jar cools, the flowers and gilding will
    be as before. Fare thee well."</p>

    <p>And even as he spoke the Jew lifted the huge crate of china
    on to his back, and disappeared among the crowd.</p>

    <p>All came about as the Jew had promised. As he had twelve
    gold pieces a day, the young man now wanted for nothing,
    besides which he had fresh flowers on his table all the year
    round.</p>

    <p>Now it is well said, "Thy business is my business, and the
    business of all beside;" for every man's affairs are his
    neighbours' property. Thus it came about that all those who
    lived near the young man were perplexed that he had such
    beautiful flowers in all seasons; and esteemed it as an injury
    to themselves that he should have them and give no explanation
    as to whence they came.</p>

    <p>At last it came to the ears of the king, and he also was
    disturbed. For he was curious, and fond of prying into small
    matters; a taste which ill becomes those of high position. But
    the king had no child to succeed him; and he was always
    suspecting those about him of plotting to obtain the crown, and
    thus he came to be for ever prying into the affairs of his
    subjects.</p>

    <p>Now when he heard of the young man who had flowers on his
    table all the year round, he desired one of his officers to go
    and question him as to how he obtained them. But the young man
    contrived to evade his questions, and the matter was at rest
    for a while.</p>

    <p>Then the king sent another messenger, with orders to press
    the young man more closely; and because the young man disdained
    to tell a lie, he said, "I get the flowers from yon china
    jar."</p>

    <p>Then the messenger returned, and said to the king, "The
    young man says that he gets the flowers from a certain china
    jar which stands in his room."</p>

    <p>Then said the king, "Bring the contents of the jar hither to
    me." And the messenger returned and brought the toad.</p>

    <p>But when the king laid hold upon the toad, it spat in his
    face; and he was poisoned and died.</p>

    <p>Then the toad sat upon the king's mouth, and would not be
    enticed away. And every one feared to touch it because it spat
    poison. And they called the wise men of the council; and they
    performed certain rites to charm away the toad, and yet it
    would not go.</p>

    <p>But after three days, the master of the toad came to the
    palace, and without saying who he was, he desired to be
    permitted to try and get the toad from the corpse of the
    king.</p>

    <p>And when he was taken into the king's chamber, he stood and
    beckoned to the toad, saying, "The person of the king and the
    bodies of the dead are sacred, wherefore come away."</p>

    <p>And the toad crawled from the king's face and came to him,
    and did not spit at him; and he put it back into the jar.</p>

    <p>Then said the wise men, "There is no one so fit to succeed
    to the kingdom as this man is; both for wisdom of speech and
    for the power of command."</p>

    <p>And what they said pleased the people; and the young man was
    made king. And in due time he married an amiable and talented
    princess, and had children. And he ruled the kingdom well and
    wisely, and was beloved till his death.</p>

    <p>Now when, after the lapse of many years, he died, there was
    great grief among the people, and his body was laid out in his
    own room, and the people were permitted to come and look upon
    his face for the last time.</p>

    <p>And among the crowd there appeared an aged Jew. And he did
    not weep as did the others; but he came and stood by the bier,
    and gazed upon the face of the dead king in silence. And after
    a while he exclaimed, and said:</p>

    <p>"Oh, wonderful spectacle! A man, and not covetous. A ruler,
    and not oppressive. Contented in poverty, and moderate in
    wealth. Elect of the people, and beloved to the end!"</p>

    <p>And when he had said this, he again became silent, and stood
    as one astonished.</p>

    <p>And no one knew when he came in, nor perceived when he
    departed.</p>

    <p>But when they came to search for the china jar, it was gone,
    and could never afterwards be found.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_FIRST_WIFES_WEDDING-RING"
       id="THE_FIRST_WIFES_WEDDING-RING"></a>THE FIRST WIFE'S
       WEDDING-RING.</h2>

    <p>Many years ago, there lived a certain worthy man who was
    twice married. By his first wife he had a son, who soon after
    his mother's death resolved to become a soldier, and go to
    foreign lands. "When one has seen the world, one values home
    the more," said he; "and if I live I shall return."</p>

    <p>So the father gave him a blessing, and his mother's
    wedding-ring, saying, "Keep this ring, and then, however long
    you stay away, and however changed you may become, by this
    token I shall know you to be my true son and heir."</p>

    <p>In a short time the father married again, and by this
    marriage also he had one son.</p>

    <p>Years passed by, and the elder brother did not return, and
    at last every one believed him to be dead. But in reality he
    was alive, and after a long time he turned his steps homewards.
    He was so much changed by age and travelling that only his
    mother would have known him again, but he had the ring tied
    safe and fast round his neck. One night, however, he was too
    far from shelter to get a bed, so he slept under a hedge, and
    when he woke in the morning the string was untied and the ring
    was gone. He spent a whole day in searching for it, but in
    vain; and at last he resolved to proceed and explain the matter
    to his father.</p>

    <p>The old man was overjoyed to see him, and fully believed his
    tale, but with the second wife it was otherwise. She was
    greatly displeased to think that her child was not now to be
    the sole heir of his father's goods; and she so pestered and
    worked upon the old man by artful and malicious speeches, that
    he consented to send away the new-comer till he should have
    found the first wife's wedding-ring.</p>

    <p>"Is the homestead I have taken such care of," she cried, "to
    go to the first vagrant who comes in with a brown face and a
    ragged coat, pretending that he is your son?"</p>

    <p>So the soldier was sent about his business; but his father
    followed him to the gate, and slipped some money into his hand,
    saying, "God speed you back again with the ring!"</p>

    <p>It was Sunday morning, and the bells were ringing for
    service as he turned sadly away.</p>

    <p>"Ding, dong!" rang the bells, "ding, dong! Why do you not
    come to church like others? Why are you not dressed in your
    Sunday clothes, and wherefore do you heave such doleful sighs,
    whilst we ring merrily? Ding, dong! ding, dong!"</p>

    <p>"Is there not a cause?" replied the soldier. "This day I am
    turned out of home and heritage, though indeed I am the true
    heir."</p>

    <p>"Nevertheless we shall ring for your return," said the
    bells.</p>

    <p>As he went, the sun shone on the green fields, and in the
    soldier's eyes, and said, "See how brightly I shine! But you,
    comrade, why is your face so cloudy?"</p>

    <p>"Is there not good reason?" replied he. "This day I am
    turned out of home and heritage, and yet I am the true
    heir."</p>

    <p>"Nevertheless I shall shine on your return," said the
    sun.</p>

    <p>Along the road the hawthorn hedges were white with blossom.
    "Heyday!" they cried, "who is this that comes trimp tramp, with
    a face as long as a poplar-tree? Cheer up, friend! It is
    spring! sweet spring! All is now full of hope and joy, and why
    should you look so sour?"</p>

    <p>"May I not be excused?" said the soldier. "This day I am
    turned out, of home and heritage, and yet I am the true
    heir."</p>

    <p>"Nevertheless we shall blossom when you return," said the
    hedges.</p>

    <p>When he had wandered for three days and three nights, all he
    had was spent, and there was no shelter to be seen but a dark
    gloomy forest, which stretched before him. Just then he saw a
    small, weazened old woman, who was trying to lift a bundle of
    sticks on to her back.</p>

    <p>"That is too heavy for you, good mother," said the soldier;
    and he raised and adjusted it for her.</p>

    <p>"Have you just come here?" muttered the old crone; "then the
    best thanks I can give you is to bid you get away as fast as
    you can."</p>

    <p>"I never retreated yet, dame," said the soldier, and on he
    went.</p>

    <p>Presently he met with a giant, who was strolling along by
    the edge of the wood, knocking the cones off the tops of the
    fir-trees with his finger-nails. He was an ill-favoured-looking
    monster, but he said, civilly enough, "You look in want of
    employment, comrade. Will you take service with me?"</p>

    <p>"I must first know two things," answered the soldier; "my
    work and my wages."</p>

    <p>"Your work," said the giant, "is to cut a path through this
    wood to the other side. But then you shall have a year and a
    day to do it in. If you do it within the time, you will find at
    the other end a magpie's nest, in which is the ring of which
    you are in search. The nest also contains the crown jewels
    which have been stolen, and if you take these to the king, you
    will need no further reward. But, on the other hand, if the
    work is not done within the time, you will thenceforth be my
    servant without wages."</p>

    <p>"It is a hard bargain," said the soldier, "but need knows no
    law, and I agree to the conditions."</p>

    <p>When he came into the giant's abode, he was greatly
    astonished to see the little weazened old woman. She showed no
    sign of recognizing him, however, and the soldier observed a
    like discretion. He soon discovered that she was the giant's
    wife, and much in dread of her husband, who treated her with
    great cruelty.</p>

    <p>"To-morrow you shall begin to work," said the giant.</p>

    <p>"If you please," said the soldier, and before he went to bed
    he carried in water and wood for the old woman.</p>

    <p>"There's a kinship in trouble," said he.</p>

    <p>Next morning the giant led him to a certain place on the
    outskirts of the forest, and giving him an axe, said, "The
    sooner you begin, the better, and you may see that it is not
    difficult." Saying which, he took hold of one of the trees by
    the middle, and snapped it off as one might pluck a flower.</p>

    <p>"Thus to thee, but how to me?" said the soldier; and when
    the giant departed he set to work. But although he was so
    strong, and worked willingly, the trees seemed almost as hard
    as stone, and he made little progress. When he returned at
    night the giant asked him how he got on.</p>

    <p>"The trees are very hard," said he.</p>

    <p>"So they always say," replied the giant; "I have always had
    idle servants."</p>

    <p>"I will not be called idle a second time," thought the
    soldier, and next day he went early and worked his utmost. But
    the result was very small. And when he came home, looking weary
    and disappointed, he could not fail to perceive that this gave
    great satisfaction to the giant.</p>

    <p>Matters had gone on thus for some time, when one morning, as
    he went to work, he found the little old woman gathering sticks
    as before.</p>

    <p>"Listen," said she. "He shall not treat you as he has
    treated others. Count seventy to the left from where you are
    working, and begin again. But do not let him know that you have
    made a fresh start. And do a little at the old place from time
    to time, as a blind." And before he could thank her, the old
    woman was gone. Without more ado, however, he counted seventy
    from the old place, and hit the seventieth tree such a blow
    with his axe, that it came crashing down then and there. And he
    found that, one after another, the trees yielded to his blows
    as if they were touch-wood. He did a good day's work, gave a
    few strokes in the old spot, and came home, taking care to look
    as gloomy as before.</p>

    <p>Day by day he got deeper and deeper into the wood, the trees
    falling before him like dry elder twigs; and now the hardest
    part of his work was walking backwards and fowards to the
    giant's home, for the forest seemed almost interminable. But on
    the three hundred and sixty-sixth day from his first meeting
    with the giant, the soldier cut fairly through on to an open
    plain, and as the light streamed in, a magpie flew away, and on
    searching her nest, the soldier found his mother's
    wedding-ring. He also found many precious stones of priceless
    value, which were evidently the lost crown jewels. And as his
    term of service with the giant was now ended, he did not
    trouble himself to return, but with the ring and the jewels in
    his pocket set off to find his way to the capital.</p>

    <p>He soon fell in with a good-humoured, fellow who showed him
    the way, and pointed out everything of interest on the road. As
    they drew near, one of the royal carriages was driving out of
    the city gates, in which sat three beautiful ladies who were
    the king's daughters.</p>

    <p>"The two eldest are engaged to marry two neighbouring
    princes," said the companion.</p>

    <p>"And whom is the youngest to marry?" asked the soldier, "for
    she is by far the most beautiful."</p>

    <p>"She will never marry," answered his companion, "for she is
    pledged to the man who shall find the crown jewels, and cut a
    path through the stone-wood forest that borders the king's
    domains. And that is much as if she were promised to the man
    who should fetch down the moon for her to play with. For the
    jewels are lost beyond recall, and the wood is an enchanted
    forest."</p>

    <p>"Nevertheless she shall be wed with my mother's ring,"
    thought the soldier. But he kept his own counsel, and only
    waited till he had smartened himself up, before he sought an
    audience of the king.</p>

    <p>His claim to the princess was fully proved; the king heaped
    honours and riches upon him; and he made himself so acceptable
    to his bride-elect, that the wedding was fixed for an early
    day.</p>

    <p>"May I bring my old father, madam?" he asked of the
    princess.</p>

    <p>"That you certainly may," said she. "A good son makes a good
    husband."</p>

    <p>As he entered his native village the hedges were in blossom,
    the sun shone; and the bells rang for his return.</p>

    <p>His stepmother now welcomed him, and was very anxious to go
    to court also. But her husband said, "No. You took such good
    care of the homestead, it is but fit you should look to it
    whilst I am away."</p>

    <p>As to the giant, when he found that he had been outwitted,
    he went off, and was never more heard of in those parts. But
    the soldier took his wife into the city, and cared for her to
    the day of her death.</p>

    <h2><a name="THE_MAGICIAN_TURNED_MISCHIEF-MAKER"
       id="THE_MAGICIAN_TURNED_MISCHIEF-MAKER"></a>THE MAGICIAN
       TURNED MISCHIEF-MAKER.</h2>

    <p>There was once a wicked magician who prospered, and did much
    evil for many years. But there came a day when Vengeance,
    disguised as a blind beggar, overtook him, and outwitted him,
    and stole his magic wand. With this he had been accustomed to
    turn those who offended him into any shape he pleased; and now
    that he had lost it he could only transform himself.</p>

    <p>As Vengeance was returning to his place, he passed through a
    village, the inhabitants of which had formerly lived in great
    terror of the magician, and told them of the downfall of his
    power. But they only said, "Blind beggars have long tongues.
    One must not believe all one hears," and shrugged their
    shoulders, and left him.</p>

    <p>Then Vengeance waved the wand and said, "As you have doubted
    me, distress each other;" and so departed.</p>

    <p>By and by he came to another village, and told the news. But
    here the villagers were full of delight, and made a feast, and
    put the blind beggar in the place of honour; who, when he
    departed, said, "As you have done by me, deal with each other
    always!" and went on to the next village.</p>

    <p>In this place he was received with even warmer welcome; and
    when the feast was over, the people brought him to the bridge
    which led out of the village, and gave him a guide-dog to help
    him on his way.</p>

    <p>Then the blind beggar waved the wand once more and said;</p>

    <p>"Those who are so good to strangers must needs be good to
    each other. But that nothing may be wanting to the peace of
    this place, I grant to the beasts and birds in it that they may
    understand the language of men."</p>

    <p>Then he broke the wand in pieces, and threw it into the
    stream. And when the people turned their heads back again from
    watching the bits as they floated away, the blind beggar was
    gone.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile the magician was wild with rage at the loss of his
    wand, for all his pleasure was to do harm and hurt. But when he
    came to himself he said: "One can do a good deal of harm with
    his tongue. I will turn mischief-maker; and when the place is
    too hot to hold me, I can escape in what form I please."</p>

    <p>Then he came to the first village, where Vengeance had gone
    before, and here he lived for a year and a day in various
    disguises; and he made more misery with his tongue than he had
    ever accomplished in any other year with his magic wand. For
    every one distrusted his neighbour, and was ready to believe
    ill of him. So parents disowned their children, and husband and
    wives parted, and lovers broke faith; and servants and masters
    disagreed; and old friends became bitter enemies, till at last
    the place was intolerable even to the magician, and he changed
    himself into a cockchafer, and flew to the next village, where,
    Vengeance had gone before.</p>

    <p>Here also he dwelt for a year and a day, and then he left it
    because he could do no harm. For those who loved each other
    trusted each other, and the magician made mischief in vain. In
    one of his disguises he was detected, and only escaped with his
    life from the enraged villagers by changing himself into a
    cockchafer and flying on to the next place, where Vengeance had
    gone before.</p>

    <p>In this village he made less mischief than in the first, and
    more than in the second. And he exercised all his art, and
    changed his disguises constantly; but the dogs knew him under
    all.</p>

    <p>One dog&mdash;the oldest dog in the place&mdash;was keeping
    watch over the miller's house, when he saw the magician
    approaching, in the disguise of an old woman.</p>

    <p>"Do you see that old witch?" said he to the sparrows, who
    were picking up stray bits of grain in the yard. "With her evil
    tongue she is parting my master's daughter and the finest young
    fellow in the country-side. She puts lies and truth together,
    with more skill than you patch moss and feathers to build
    nests. And when she is asked where she heard this or that, she
    says, 'A little bird told me so.'"</p>

    <p>"We never told her," said the sparrows indignantly, "and if
    we had your strength, Master Keeper, she should not malign us
    long!"</p>

    <p>"I believe you are right!" said Master Keeper. "Of what
    avail is it that we have learned the language of men, if we do
    not help them to the utmost of our powers? She shall torment my
    young mistress no more."</p>

    <p>Saying which he flew upon the disguised magician as he
    entered the gate, and would have torn him limb from limb, but
    that the mischief-maker changed himself as before into a
    cockchafer, and flew hastily from the village.</p>

    <p>And thus he might doubtless have escaped to do yet further
    harm, had not three cock-sparrows overtaken him just before he
    crossed the bridge.</p>

    <p>From three sides they hemmed him in, crying, "Which of us
    told you?" "Which of us told you?" "Which of us told
    you?"&mdash;and pecked him to pieces before he could transform
    himself again.</p>

    <p>After which peace and prosperity befell all the
    neighbourhood.</p>

    <p>A Fool and a Knave once set up house together; which shows
    what a fool the Fool was.</p>

    <p>The Knave was delighted with the agreement; and the Fool
    thought himself most fortunate to have met with a companion who
    would supply his lack of mother-wit.</p>

    <p>As neither of them liked work, the Knave proposed that they
    should live upon their joint savings as long as these should
    last; and, to avoid disputes, that they should use the Fool's
    share till it came to an end, and then begin upon the Knave's
    stocking.</p>

    <p>So, for a short time, they lived in great comfort at the
    Fool's expense, and were very good company; for easy times make
    easy tempers.</p>

    <p>Just when the store was exhausted, the Knave came running to
    the Fool with an empty bag and a wry face, crying, "Dear
    friend, what shall we do? This bag, which I had safely buried
    under a gooseberry-bush, has been taken up by some thief, and
    all my money stolen. My savings were twice as large as yours;
    but now that they are gone, and I can no longer perform my
    share of the bargain, I fear our partnership must be
    dissolved."</p>

    <p>"Not so, dear friend," said the Fool, who was very
    good-natured; "we have shared good luck together, and now we
    will share poverty. But as nothing is left, I fear we must seek
    work."</p>

    <p>"You speak very wisely," said the Knave, "And what, for
    instance, can you do?"</p>

    <p>"Very little," said the Fool; "but that little I do
    well."</p>

    <p>"So do I," said the Knave. "Now can you plough, or sow, or
    feed cattle, or plant crops?"</p>

    <p>"Farming is not my business," said the Fool.</p>

    <p>"Nor mine," said the Knave; "but no doubt you are a
    handicraftsman. Are you clever at carpentry, mason's work,
    tailoring, or shoemaking?"</p>

    <p>"I do not doubt that I should have been had I learned the
    trades," said the Fool, "but I never was bound apprentice."</p>

    <p>"It is the same with myself," said the Knave; "but you may
    have finer talents. Can you paint, or play the fiddle?"</p>

    <p>"I never tried," said the Fool; "so I don't know."</p>

    <p>"Just my case," said the Knave. "And now, since we can't
    find work, I propose that we travel till work finds us."</p>

    <p>The two comrades accordingly set forth, and they went on and
    on, till they came to the foot of a hill, where a merchantman
    was standing by his wagon, which had broken down.</p>

    <p>"You seem two strong men," said he, as they advanced; "if
    you will carry this chest of valuables up to the top of the
    hill, and down to the bottom on the other side, where there is
    an inn, I will give you two gold pieces for your trouble."</p>

    <p>The Knave and the Fool consented to this, saying, "Work has
    found us at last;" and they lifted the box on to their
    shoulders.</p>

    <p>"Turn, and turn about," said the Knave; "but the best turn
    between friends is a good turn; so I will lead the way up-hill,
    which is the hardest kind of travelling, and you shall go first
    down-hill, the easy half of our journey."</p>

    <p>The Fool thought this proposal a very generous one, and, not
    knowing that the lower end of their burden was the heavy one,
    he carried it all the way. When they got to the inn, the
    merchant gave each of them a gold piece, and, as the
    accommodation was good, they remained where they were till
    their money was spent. After this, they lived there awhile on
    credit; and when that was exhausted, they rose one morning
    whilst the landlord was still in bed, and pursued their
    journey, leaving old scores behind them.</p>

    <p>They had been a long time without work or food, when they
    came upon a man who sat by the roadside breaking stones, with a
    quart of porridge and a spoon in a tin pot beside him.</p>

    <p>"You look hungry, friends," said he, "and I, for my part,
    want to get away. If you will break up this heap, you shall
    have the porridge for supper. But when you have eaten it, put
    the pot and spoon under the hedge, that I may find them when I
    return."</p>

    <p>"If we eat first, we shall have strength for our work," said
    the Knave; "and as there is only one spoon, we must eat by
    turns. But fairly divide, friendly abide. As you went first the
    latter part of our journey, I will begin on this occasion. When
    I stop, you fall to, and eat as many spoonfuls as I ate. Then I
    will follow you in like fashion, and so on till the pot is
    empty."</p>

    <p>"Nothing could be fairer," said the Fool; and the Knave
    began to eat, and went on till he had eaten a third of the
    porridge. The Fool, who had counted every spoonful, now took
    his turn, and ate precisely as much as his comrade. The Knave
    then began again, and was exact to a mouthful; but it emptied
    the pot. Thus the Knave had twice as much as the Fool, who
    could not see where he had been cheated.</p>

    <p>They then set to work.</p>

    <p>"As there is only one hammer," said the Knave, "we must
    work, as we supped, by turns; and as I began last time, you
    shall begin this. After you have worked awhile, I will take the
    hammer from you, and do as much myself whilst you rest. Then
    you shall take it up again, and so on till the heap is
    finished."</p>

    <p>"It is not every one who is as just as you," said the Fool;
    and taking up the hammer, he set to work with a will.</p>

    <p>The Knave took care to let him go on till he had broken a
    third of the stones, and then he did as good a share himself;
    after which the Fool began again, and finished the heap.</p>

    <p>By this means the Fool did twice as much work as the Knave,
    and yet he could not complain.</p>

    <p>As they moved on again, the Fool perceived that the Knave
    was taking the can and the spoon with him.</p>

    <p>"I am sorry to see you do that, friend," said he.</p>

    <p>"It's a very small theft," said the Knave. "The can cannot
    have cost more than sixpence when new."</p>

    <p>"That was not what I meant," said the Fool, "so much as that
    I fear the owner will find it out."</p>

    <p>"He will only think the things have been stolen by some
    vagrant," said the Knave&mdash;"which, indeed, they would be if
    we left them. But as you seem to have a tender conscience, I
    will keep them myself."</p>

    <p>After a while they met with a farmer, who offered to give
    them supper and a night's lodging, if they would scare the
    birds from a field of corn for him till sunset.</p>

    <p>"I will go into the outlying fields," said the Knave, "and
    as I see the birds coming, I will turn them back. You, dear
    friend, remain in the corn, and scare away the few that may
    escape me."</p>

    <p>But whilst the Fool clapped and shouted till he was tired,
    the Knave went to the other side of the hedge, and lay down for
    a nap.</p>

    <p>As they sat together at supper, the Fool said, "Dear friend,
    this is laborious work. I propose that we ask the farmer to let
    us tend sheep, instead. That is a very different affair. One
    lies on the hillside all day. The birds do not steal sheep; and
    all this shouting and clapping is saved."</p>

    <p>The Knave very willingly agreed, and next morning the two
    friends drove a flock of sheep on to the downs. The sheep at
    once began to nibble, the dog sat with his tongue out, panting,
    and the Knave and Fool lay down on their backs, and covered
    their faces with their hats to shield them from the sun.</p>

    <p>Thus they lay till evening, when, the sun being down, they
    uncovered their faces, and found that the sheep had all strayed
    away, and the dog after them.</p>

    <p>"The only plan for us is to go separate ways in search of
    the flock," said the Knave; "only let us agree to meet here
    again." They accordingly started in opposite directions; but
    when the Fool was fairly off, the Knave returned to his place,
    and lay down as before.</p>

    <p>By and by the dog brought the sheep back; so that, when the
    Fool returned, the Knave got the credit of having found them;
    for the dog scorned to explain his part in the matter.</p>

    <p>As they sat together at supper, the Fool said, "The work is
    not so easy as I thought. Could we not find a better trade
    yet?"</p>

    <p>"Can you beg?" said the Knave. "A beggar's trade is both
    easy and profitable. Nothing is required but walking and
    talking. Then one walks at his own pace, for there is no hurry,
    and no master, and the same tale does for every door. And, that
    all may be fair and equal, you shall beg at the front door,
    whilst I ask an alms at the back."</p>

    <p>To this the Fool gladly agreed; and as he was as lean as a
    hunted cat, charitable people gave him a penny or two from time
    to time. Meanwhile, the Knave went round to the back yard,
    where he picked up a fowl, or turkey, or anything that he could
    lay his hands upon.</p>

    <p>When he returned to the Fool, he would say, "See what has
    been given to me, whilst you have only got a few pence."</p>

    <p>At last this made the Fool discontented, and he said, "I
    should like now to exchange with you. I will go to the back
    doors, and you to the front."</p>

    <p>The Knave consented, and at the next house the Fool went to
    the back door; but the mistress of the farm only rated him, and
    sent him away. Meanwhile, the Knave, from the front, had
    watched her leave the parlour, and slipping in through the
    window, he took a ham and a couple of new loaves from the
    table, and so made off.</p>

    <p>When the friends met, the Fool was crestfallen at his ill
    luck, and the Knave complained that all the burden of their
    support fell upon him. "See," said he, "what they give me,
    where you get only a mouthful of abuse!" And he dined heartily
    on what he had stolen; but the Fool only had bits of the
    breadcrust, and the parings of the ham.</p>

    <p>At the next place the Fool went to the front door as before,
    and the Knave secured a fat goose and some plums in the back
    yard, which he popped under his cloak. The Fool came away with
    empty hands, and the Knave scolded him, saying, "Do you suppose
    that I mean to share this fat goose with a lazy beggar like
    you? Go on, and find for yourself." With which he sat down and
    began to eat the plums, whilst the Fool walked on alone.</p>

    <p>After a while, however, the Knave saw a stir in the
    direction of the farm they had left, and he quickly perceived
    that the loss of the goose was known, and that the farmer and
    his men were in pursuit of the thief. So, hastily picking up
    the goose, he overtook the Fool, and pressed it into his arms,
    saying, "Dear friend, pardon a passing ill humour, of which I
    sincerely repent. Are we not partners in good luck and ill? I
    was wrong, dear friend; and, in token of my penitence, the
    goose shall be yours alone. And here are a few plums with which
    you may refresh yourself by the wayside. As for me, I will
    hasten on to the next farm, and see if I can beg a bottle of
    wine to wash down the dinner, and drink to our
    good-fellowship." And before the Fool could thank him, the
    Knave was off like the wind.</p>

    <p>By and by the farmer and his men came up, and found the Fool
    eating the plums, with the goose on the grass beside him.</p>

    <p>They hurried him off to the justice, where his own story met
    with no credit. The woman of the next farm came up also, and
    recognized him for the man who had begged at her door the day
    she lost a ham and two new loaves. In vain he said that these
    things also had been given to his friend. The friend never
    appeared; and the poor Fool was whipped and put in the
    stocks.</p>

    <p>Towards evening the Knave hurried up to the village green,
    where his friend sat doing penance for the theft.</p>

    <p>"My dear friend," said he, "what do I see? Is such cruelty
    possible? But I hear that the justice is not above a bribe, and
    we must at any cost obtain your release. I am going at once to
    pawn my own boots and cloak, and everything about me that I can
    spare, and if you have anything to add, this is no time to
    hesitate."</p>

    <p>The poor Fool begged his friend to draw off his boots, and
    to take his hat and coat as well, and to make all speed on his
    charitable errand.</p>

    <p>The Knave, took all that he could get, and, leaving his
    friend sitting in the stocks in his shirt-sleeves, he
    disappeared as swiftly as one could wish a man to carry a
    reprieve.</p>

    <p>For those good folks to whom everything must be explained in
    full, it may be added that the Knave did not come back, and
    that he kept the clothes.</p>

    <p>It was very hard on the Fool; but what can one expect if he
    keeps company with a Knave?</p>
    <hr style="width: 65%;">

    <h2><a name="UNDER_THE_SUN"
       id="UNDER_THE_SUN"></a>UNDER THE SUN.</h2>

    <p>There once lived a farmer who was so avaricious and miserly,
    and so hard and close in all his dealings that, as folks say,
    he would skin a flint. A Jew and a Yorkshireman had each tried
    to bargain with him, and both had had the worst of it. It is
    needless to say that he never either gave or lent.</p>

    <p>Now, by thus scraping, and saving, and grinding for many
    years, he had become almost wealthy; though, indeed, he was no
    better fed and dressed than if he had not a penny to bless
    himself with. But what vexed him sorely was that his next
    neighbour's farm prospered in all matters better than his own;
    and this, although the owner was as open-handed as our farmer
    was stingy.</p>

    <p>When in spring he ploughed his own worn-out land, and
    reached the top of the furrow where his field joined one of the
    richly-fed fields of his neighbour, he would cast an envious
    glance over the hedge, and say, "So far and no farther?" for he
    would have liked to have had the whole under his plough. And so
    in the autumn, when he gathered his own scanty crop and had to
    stop his sickle short of the close ranks of his neighbour's
    corn, he would cry, "All this, and none of that?" and go home
    sorely discontented.</p>

    <p>Now on the lands of the liberal farmer (whose name was
    Merryweather) there lived a dwarf or hillman, who made a wager
    that he would both beg and borrow of the covetous farmer, and
    out-bargain him to boot. So he went one day to his house, and
    asked him if he would kindly give him half a stone of flour to
    make hasty pudding with; adding, that if he would lend him a
    bag to carry it in to the hill, this should be returned clean
    and in good condition.</p>

    <p>The farmer saw with half an eye that this was the dwarf from
    his neighbour's estate, and as he had always laid the luck of
    the liberal farmer to his being favoured by the good people, he
    resolved to treat the little man with all civility.</p>

    <p>"Look you, wife," said he, "this is no time to be saving
    half a stone of flour when we may make our fortunes at one
    stroke. I have heard my grandfather tell of a man who lent a
    sack of oats to one of the fairies, and got it back filled with
    gold pieces. And as good measure as he gave of oats so he got
    of gold;" saying which, the farmer took a canvas bag to the
    flour-bin, and began to fill it. Meanwhile the dwarf sat in the
    larder window and cried&mdash;"We've a big party for supper
    to-night; give us good measure, neighbour, and you shall have
    anything under the sun that you like to ask for."</p>

    <p>When the farmer heard this he was nearly out of his wits
    with delight, and his hands shook so that the flour spilled all
    about the larder floor.</p>

    <p>"Thank you, dear sir," he said; "it's a bargain, and I agree
    to it. My wife hears us, and is witness. Wife! wife!" he cried,
    running into the kitchen, "I am to have anything under the sun
    that I choose to ask for. I think of asking for neighbour
    Merryweather's estate, but this is a chance never likely to
    happen again, and I should like to make a wise choice, and that
    is not easy at a moment's notice."</p>

    <p>"You will have a week to think it over in," said the dwarf,
    who had come in behind him; "I must be off now, so give me my
    flour, and come to the hill behind your house seven days hence
    at midnight, and you shall have your share of the bargain."</p>

    <p>So the farmer tied up the flour-sack, and helped the dwarf
    with it on to his back, and as he did so he began thinking how
    easily the bargain had been made, and casting about in his mind
    whether, he could not get more where he had so easily got
    much.</p>

    <p>"And half a stone of flour is half a stone of flour," he
    muttered to himself, "and whatever it may do with thriftless
    people, it goes a long way in our house. And there's the
    bag&mdash;and a terrible lot spilled on the larder
    floor&mdash;and the string to tie it with, which doubtless
    he'll never think of returning&mdash;and my time, which must be
    counted, and nothing whatever for it all for a week to come."
    And the outlay so weighed upon his mind that he cleared his
    throat and began:</p>

    <p>"Not for seven days, did you say, sir? You know, dear sir,
    or perhaps, indeed, you do not know, that when amongst each
    other we men have to wait for the settlement of an account, we
    expect something over and above the exact amount. Interest we
    call it, my dear sir."</p>

    <p>"And you want me to give you something extra for waiting a
    week?" asked the dwarf. "Pray, what do you expect?"</p>

    <p>"Oh, dear sir, I leave it to you," said the farmer. "Perhaps
    you may add some trifle&mdash;in the flour-bag, or not, as you
    think fit&mdash;but I leave it entirely to you."</p>

    <p>"I will give you something over and above what you shall
    choose," said the dwarf; "but, as you say, I shall decide what
    it is to be." With which he shouldered the flour-sack, and went
    his way.</p>

    <p>For the next seven days, the farmer had no peace for
    thinking, and planning, and scheming how to get the most out of
    his one wish. His wife made many suggestions to which he did
    not agree, but he was careful not to quarrel with her; "for,"
    he said, "we will not be like the foolish couple who wasted
    three wishes on black-puddings. Neither will I desire useless
    grandeur and unreasonable elevation, like the fisherman's wife.
    I will have a solid and substantial benefit."</p>

    <p>And so, after a week of sleepless nights and anxious days,
    he came back to his first thought, and resolved to ask for his
    neighbour's estate.</p>

    <p>At last the night came. It was full moon, and the farmer
    looked anxiously about, fearing the dwarf might not be true to
    his appointment. But at midnight he appeared, with the
    flour-bag neatly folded in his hand.</p>

    <p>"You hold to the agreement," said the farmer, "of course. My
    wife was witness. I am to have anything under the sun that I
    ask for; and I am to have it now."</p>

    <p>"Ask away," said the dwarf.</p>

    <p>"I want neighbour Merryweather's estate," said the
    farmer.</p>

    <p>"What, all this land below here, that joins on to your
    own?"</p>

    <p>"Every acre," said the farmer.</p>

    <p>"Farmer Merryweather's fields are under the moon at
    present," said the dwarf, coolly, "and thus not within the
    terms of the agreement. You must choose again."</p>

    <p>But as the farmer could choose nothing that was not then
    under the moon, he soon saw that he had been outwitted, and his
    rage knew no bounds at the trick the dwarf had played him.</p>

    <p>"Give me my bag, at any rate," he screamed, "and the
    string&mdash;and your own extra gift that you promised. For
    half a loaf is better than no bread," he muttered, "and I may
    yet come in for a few gold pieces."</p>

    <p>"There's your bag," cried the dwarf, clapping it over the
    miser's head like an extinguisher; "it's clean enough for a
    nightcap. And there's your string," he added, tying it tightly
    round the farmer's throat till he was almost throttled. "And,
    for my part, I'll give you what you deserve;" saying which he
    gave the farmer such a hearty kick that he kicked him straight
    down from the top of the hill to his own back door.</p>

    <p>"If that does not satisfy you, I'll give you as much again,"
    shouted the dwarf; and as the farmer made no reply, he went
    chuckling back to his hill.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://gutenberg.org/license">http://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
